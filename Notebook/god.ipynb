This uni-\\nversal nature of religion\\nis an outstanding fact in the history of man-\\nkind. There have been many religions, many beliefs about the gods and\\nmany ways of worshiping them. A number of great historical religions\\nhave risen, flourished for a time, and then died out; among them: the\\nreligions of ancient Egypt, Babylonia, the Hittites, the cult of the sun\\ngod called Mithraism, and Manichaeism which saw life as a conflict\\nof light and darkness, the beliefs of the ancient Greeks, the Romans,\\nthe Celts, the Scandinavians, and the Teutons, and in the Americas\\nthe religions of the Incas, Mayas, and Aztecs.\\nThere are eleven great ‘living” religions and several smaller religions\\ntoday. Four of\\nthese,\\nChristianity, Mohammedanism, Confucianism,\\nand Hinduism, are maintaining their growth. Four, Judaism, Buddhism,,\\nSikhism, and Taoism, show neither gain nor loss over a long period of\\ntime. Three of the world’s great religions, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, and\\nShinto, are definitely on the decline.\\nAmong the lesser religious bodies of today are two of particular interv.\\nest to people of the United States. These are the Latter Day Saints, or\\nMormons, and the Church of Christ,\\nScientist, usually referred to as\\nChristian Science. Mormonism is a relatively small organization having\\nthe greater part of\\nits membership in Utah. The Church of Christ,\\nScientist, founded in Massachusetts, is steadily growing.\\nThe world’s ‘living”\\nreligions differ from the “dead’*\\nreligions in\\nthat they cherish certain definite writings as sacred. The religions which\\nhave ceased to exist have left no sacred canon or body of scriptures.\\nTheir literature was\\nscattered, most of\\nit being handed down from\\nfather to son, or “priest” to worshiper, by word of mouth. A little of it\\nwas collected much later and written down in such books as the Iliad\\nand the Odyssey of Homer. But most of the lore about the gods and\\n2\\nINTRODUCTION\\ntheir doings, the nature of the universe and of life after death, the laws\\nand moral precepts of the religion, were never brought together into\\nanything that could be called a canon.\\nThe sacred writings, or scriptures of the world’s living religions are:\\nChristianity: The Bible\\ny\\nconsisting of the Old and New Testa-\\nments, and certain books known as the Apocrypha.\\nConfucianism :\\nFive Classics and The Four Books. Included in\\nthe former are the Shu King or Canon of History\\n,\\nthe Shih Kmg of\\nCanon of Poetry\\ny\\nthe I King or Canon of Changes\\ny\\nthe Li Ki or Book\\nof RiteSy and the Chun Chiu or Spring and Autumn Annals. Some\\nauthorities add a sixth Classic, the Hsiao King or Book of Filial Piety.\\nThe latter consist of the Ta Hsio or Great Learningy the Chung Yung\\nor Doctrine of the MeaUy the Lun Yu or Analects of ConfuciuSy and the\\nMeng-tze ox Works of Mencius.\\nMohammedanism : The KoraUy consisting of 114 chapters or Suras.\\nThe first chapter is a short opening prayer, the famous Fatihah. The\\nother 113 chapters are arranged in the order of their length from one\\nof 286 verses to one of three verses.\\nHinduism: The Vedas or Books of Knowledge. These have their\\norigin sometime before 1000 b.g. and form the basis for all Hinduism.\\nThere are four of these Vedas: Tho Rig-Veda or Veda of Versesy the\\nYajur Veda or Veda of Sacred FormulaSy the Sama Veda or the Veda\\nof ChantSy and the Atharva Veda ox Veda of Charms. During the long\\nperiod between the writing of these books and the beginning of the\\nChristian era, Hinduism went through several changes affecting groups\\nwithin the main body of the religion. Out of each change there came a\\nliterature which was accepted as sacred by the groups concerned. The\\nSatapatha Brahmana\\nis an outgrowth of the priestly development of\\nHinduism during the period from 1000 b.g. to 800 b.g. This develop-\\nment was followed, between 800 and 600 b.g., by a philosophic interest\\nout of which came the Upanishads or books of philosophic discussion.\\nIn about 250 b.g. Hinduism developed a strong legalistic tone and from\\nthis was produced the Laws of Manu or code of Hindu law. Then, at\\nthe beginning of the Christian era a great many Hindus began to place\\nconsiderable emphasis upon prayer and devotion. These produced thi\\nBhagavad GitUy a dramatic poem of great beauty and high moral pre-\\ncepts. While these documents constitute the sacred books of Hinduism,\\nthere are two Epics and eighteen Puranas\\ny\\ndating from the beginning.\\nINTRODUCTION\\n3\\n.of the Christian era to about 250 a.d., which have had Gonsiderable\\ninfluence upon popular Hinduism. The Epics are the Mahahharata or\\nThe Great Bharata War and the Ramayana or The Career of the God\\nRama. Of the Puranas the Vishnu^ Garuda^ and Markandeya are most\\nimportant.\\nBuddhism\\n: The Tripitaka ox Three Baskets of teachings. These con-\\nsist of the Vinaya Pitaka or Discipline Basket, the Sutta Pitaka or\\nTeaching Basket, and the Ahhidhamma Pitaka or Metaphysical Basket,\\nAlso The Dhammapada ox Way of Virtue,\\nTaoism: The Tao-Teh-Kmg or Canon.of Reason and Virtue, This\\nbook consists of a number of generalizations and wise sayings gathered\\ntogether with no system or plan. In addition to this basic sacred text,\\nTapists revere the Tai-Shang Kang-Ying Pien or Tractate of Actions\\nand Their Retributions, This volume contains many very crude and\\nprimitive teachings along with passages which rival anything in the\\nbest of moral literature. A third book, classified as non-canonical, is the\\nKwang-Tze ox Works of Kwang-Tze.\\nShinto: Ko-juki or Records of Ancient Matters and Nihon-gi ox\\nChronicles of Japan, The\\nfirst is the story of deeds and conversations\\nin the ‘‘age of the gods” before men existed on this earth. The second\\ntells of the creation of Japan and the rule of the Emperors. Neither\\nbook is historically reliable. A third sacred document of Shinto\\nis the\\nYengi-shiki or Institutes of the Period of Yengi, This book consists of\\n50 chapters, dating from about the 10th century a.d. Its text is a series\\nof prayers for various occasions. A fourth among the sacred Shinto\\nwritings is the Manyo-shiu or Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves, an\\nanthology of 4496 poems dating from the 5th to the 8th centuries a.d.\\nJudaism: The Old Testament and the Talmud, The former con-\\nsists of three sections: The Law, The Prophets, and The Sacred Writ-\\nings. The latter is divided into the Mishna or text and the Gemara or\\nCommentary on the text. In addition some scholars include the Old\\nTestament Apocrypha as part of the Jewish sacred\\nscriptures. This\\nconsists of a group of writings produced by Jews of ancient times but\\nnot officially admitted to the sacred canon.\\nSikhism; Granth or The Book, This h a collection of poems total-\\ning about 29,480 verses dealing with meditation about God and ex-\\nhortation\\nto a moral\\nlife. There are\\nseveral\\ncomposed\\nat\\n4\\nINTRODUCTION\\ndifferent times and containing differences in material. The\\nis the oldest, dating from 1604 a.d. The orthodox Sikhs recognize the\\nauthority of the Dasam Granth or the Granth of the Tenth Guru,\\nz.\\nlater compilation.\\nJainism : The Agamas or Precepts, Another name often used for\\nthese writings is Siddhantas or Treatises, This consists of an undeter-\\nmined number of sacred documents. One sect, the Sthanakvasi, recog-\\nnizes 33 documents as canonical while another sect, the Svetambara,\\nrecognizes 45 documents. Some Jains hold that there are actually 84\\nsacred documents to be included in the canon. The first section of the\\nconsisted of 12 Angas or bodies, of which only 11 are known,\\nthe\\n12th having been\\nlost. Four important Agamas are:\\nAkaranga,\\nKalpa, Uttaradhyayana, and Sutrakritanga,\\nZoroastrianism: Avesta ot Knowledge, This consists of four main\\ngroups. The Yasna deals with worship and sacrifice and contains the\\n17 Gathas or Psalms, The Visperad is a collection of invocations to all\\nthe gods. The Vendidad is a priestly code of ceremonial laws dealing\\nwith methods of fighting demons. The Yashts is an anthology of reli-\\ngious poetry or worship hymns. A fifth document, sometimes included\\nas part of the Avesta,\\nis the Khorda-Avesta or Little Avesta, a devo-\\ntional handbook of litanies and prayers used by all Zoroastrians as a\\ndaily guide to worship and prayer.\\nMormonism\\n: Book of Mormon offers a history of the Lost Tribes of\\nIsrael, connecting them with the ancestors of the American aborigines.\\nThe Mormons also accept the Bible, “if correctly translated,” as sacred.\\nChurch of Christ, Scientist: The Bible\\nis the sacred book of\\nthis religious group. Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, a\\ncommentary by Mary Baker Eddy,\\nis the volume around which the\\nchurch is organized and is held by the members to have a special reli-\\ngious value.\\nAlthough each religion\\nis distinct from\\nall others in much that\\nis\\nessential, there are certain basic teachings which are common to\\nall.\\nEvery religion has some individual possessing divine qualities and claim-\\ning the veneration of all its adherents. Early Buddhism and early Jain-\\nism denied the existence of a Supreme Being, but later both developed\\na worship of the founder. Judaism has always worshiped one God,\\nJehovah. Before the exile it admitted that other gods existed and might\\nINTRODUCTION\\n5\\nbe worshiped by other people. After the exile it came to deny the exist-\\nence of any other god than Jehovah. While Confucianism teaches the\\nworship of one Supreme Ruler, popular Confucianism worships a great\\nhost of nature spirits and also the spirits of dead ancestors.\\nIn\\nZoroastrianism we\\nfind two\\npowerful\\nforces, Ahura Mazda,\\nsupremely worshipful, and Angra Mainyu,\\nthe\\nspirit of\\nevil. Many\\nother good spirits are also worshiped. In both Hinduism and Taoism\\nwe find the doctrine of a Supreme Being. For the Hindu this power is\\nBrahma and for the Taoist it is the Tao or Way. Neither is worshiped\\nin any real sense of the term. In the popular phases of both religions\\nthere\\nare many\\ndeities which command\\nworship.\\nIn\\nChristianity,\\nSikhism, and Mohammedanism there\\nis definite belief in a Supreme\\nPower who deserves complete worship.\\nIn many of the world’s living religions\\nis to be found the idea that\\nthe Supreme Being has become flesh and dwelt among men. Philosophic\\nHinduism holds that every object is in some degree a manifestation of\\nthe Brahma. Popular Hinduism is full of gods who have taken the form\\nof men. Vishnu is held to have visited the earth many times in various\\nforms,\\nincluding\\nthe forms\\nof\\nanimals. Buddhism\\nteaches\\nthat\\nthe\\nBuddha was one of 24 incarnations of “The Buddha” and that there\\nis to be another incarnation. The Mohammedan\\nsect,\\nShiite, broke\\nfrom the Sunnite sect on the Belief that Ali, fourth caliph, was a divine\\nincarnation of Allah and thus the real successor of the prophet Mo-\\nhammed. Some members of the sect hold that there have been other\\nincarnations.\\nChristianity holds that Jesus\\nChrist was\\nactually God\\nliving for a time in the form of man.\\nThe belief that the founder of a religion was of supernatural origin\\nis\\nto be found\\nin many of the world’s\\nliving\\nreligions.\\nChristianity\\nteaches that Jesus was the Son of God born of a virgin through divine\\nconception. The Buddha\\nis held to have been the divine child of a\\nqueen and to have had a pre-existence in heaven. Lao-tze is represented\\nas having been born fully matured after being carried in his mother’s\\nwomb for 72 or 81\\nyears, according to\\ndifferent translations of the\\nscripture. At his birth he was a “Wise Old Boy” or “Wise Old Philos-\\nopher” with white hair.\\nThe founder of Jainism, Mahavira,\\nis believed\\nto have\\nlived in\\nheaven before being supernaturally placed in his mother’s womb and\\nthen born after his mother had 14 prophetic dreams about him and\\nhis coming. The mother of Zoroaster is believed to have been “glorified”\\nwhen she was a virgin of only\\n1\\n5\\nyears, consequently Zoroastrians hold\\nthat all future saviors will be born of a virgin mother of 15 years.\\nEach religion lays claim to being the avenue of some divine revela-\\n6\\nINTRODUCTION\\ntion of truth. The Supreme Being and the founder or early leader of\\nthe religion is believed to have had some supernatural access to Truth\\nand has shown this Truth to his followers. As a result, those who follow\\nthe religion and read its sacred writings are believed to be in possession\\nof this Truth. For example, Hinduism teaches that the divine is in the\\nworld and that the society of men and women is a divinely built struc-\\nture. As members of society, each follower of Hinduism\\nis part of this\\ndivine structure and has access to the divine. As he becomes one with\\nthe divine, he moves toward the goal of all\\nlife. Thus, people must\\nreturn to life again and again until they have become completely united\\nwith the divine that\\nis in the universe. When\\nthis state\\nis reached,\\npeople cease to exist as individuals, and live forever as the divine.\\nFurther, all the living religions believe firmly that their sacred scrip-\\ntures are divinely inspired, that is, that they have come directly from\\nthe Supreme Being believed in by the followers of the religion. Since\\nthey originate in this way, it is held that they reveal divine truth that\\nis not to be questioned. ThQ Rig-Veda and’the Xoran are held to be\\nthe exact words dictated by the Supreme Being and taken down without\\nchange; thus one who reads them reads the actual words of the god.\\nMany Christians hold to this same theory as regards the Bible.\\nIn many other respects the world’s living religions agree. Among\\nthese\\nis\\nthe contention that the founder and\\nthe\\nespecially sainted\\nmen and women in^ the religion’s history were workers of miracles, that\\nthe followers of the religion constitute an especially sacred community\\nor ‘\"church” which has peculiar protection from the god or Supreme\\nBeing, and that belief in the religion and careful obedience to its laws\\nand precepts will insure rewards in the life after death.\\nBut these religions differ in many respects. And this is to be expected\\nwhen\\nit\\nis recognized that every religion has\\nits origin in the racial\\nexperiences of a people. Each religion has a history, and the history of\\neach differs from that of all the others. This history\\nis the history of\\nthe people who gradually, through hundreds or thousands of years,\\nhave built up\\ntheir belief out of their needs and experiences,\\ntheir\\nsufferings and successes, their defeats and victories.\\nA careful study of any religion will reveal how it has changed as the\\nlife of the people has changed. For example, when the early Hebrews\\nwere nothing more than a tribe of nomads wandering over the land\\nfrom Ur of the Chaldees to Egypt, their religion was a crude form of\\nworship\\nof nature\\ngods. These gods were\\ncruel and had\\nparticular\\nconcern with, the welfare of this nomadic people. Later their religion\\nbecame that of a\\nsettled,\\ncattle-raising and farming people. As the\\nnation grew, the religion became such as fitted the needs of the nation.\\nINTRODUCTION\\n7\\nAnd when the Hebrews began to think in terms of other peoples, their\\nreligion, during the period\\nof the prophets, became more and more\\nuniversal. Thus it was possible eventually for Christianity, a world re-\\nligion, to grow out of the Hebrew religion. In this we see a religion\\ngrowing and developing from a small tribal affair to a worldwide gospel\\nas the people developed and changed.\\nIt\\nis natural, then, that each religion should take on the character-\\nistics of the people around whose culture it developed. The surprising\\nthing\\nis that the world’s living religions are so much alike in many\\nrespects.\\nConsidering\\nthe\\ngreat\\ndiversity\\nof\\ncultural\\ndevelopments\\nthroughout the world, it is a wonder that the religions of mankind are\\nat\\nall\\nalike. The\\nonly\\npossible explanation\\nis\\nthat\\nthe\\nreligions\\nof\\npresent-day mankind were cradled in the East and began with people\\nwho were much alike. Then too, religion is one of the most conservative\\nfactors in human history. While people will change their political and\\nsocial\\nlife radically over a period of time, they change their religious\\nbeliefs\\nslowly. Add\\nto\\nthis the fact that these\\nreligions have sacred\\ndocuments believed to be inspired and handed down from early times\\nwith the halo of the divine about them, it becomes evident that there\\nwill be many similarities among the religions of the world.\\nIn this volume we shall come to know the sacred writings of the\\nworld’s great living religions. We shall read from the sacred books pas-\\nsages which give the flavor of the writings and suggest the doctrines\\ntaught by them. For here are selected masterpieces of the world’s great\\nreligious\\nliterature, which have given to\\ncountless millions comfort,\\nguidance, and inspiration.\\nI\\nHINDUISM\\nHinduism\\nis the oldest living organized religion in the worlds dating\\nfrom a time between 2000 and 1500 b.g. From\\nits beginnings to the\\npresent\\nit has been changing and growing so that few of the beliefs\\nand doctrines of the earliest Hindus are accepted in their original form\\nby present-day adherents of the religion.\\nAlthough confined almost wholly to India^ Hinduism has been add-\\ning steadily to its membership through a natural increase of the popula-\\ntion. Some estimates place the annual increase at a little over IjOOO^OOO.\\nThe present membership\\nis slightly more than 240,000,000.\\nFundamental to Hinduism, and the one factor which is to be found\\nthroughout the history of this religion from its earliest beginnings to\\nthe present,\\nis strict adherence to a caste system. Hindus differ widely\\nin their beliefs about theological matters while remaining Hindus just\\nthe same, yet they all agree regarding the caste system. Indeed,\\nit has\\nbeen said, \\'‘No one is interested in what his neighbor believes, but he is\\nvery much interested in knowing whether he can eat with him or take\\nwater from his hands.”\\nThere are four chief castes in Hinduism. Members of each are re-\\nquired by strict religious laws to follow certain hereditary occupations\\nand to refrain from intermarriage or eating with members of the other\\ncastes. The highest, or priestly and\\nintellectual,\\ncaste\\nis that of the\\nBrahmans. Next to this in rank is the Kshatriya, or ruling and warrior\\ncaste. The Vaisya, or common artisan and agricultural caste,\\nis below\\nthe Kshatriya. At the very bottom of the caste system are the Sudras, or\\nlow-caste people. Within each of these four castes there are numer-\\nous subdivisions,\\nso that there are now more than 2,0G0\\ncastes, each\\nliving largely to itself and excluding all others.\\nThere are strict religious laws keeping each caste out of contact with\\nall others, and the penalties for disregarding these laws are, in many\\ncases, most severe. However, there is today some agitation in India for\\nan abandonment of these hard and fast lines. This movement\\nis con-\\n9\\n10\\nHINDUISM\\nfined to a few inteU^^\\nJ^ttle or no impression upon\\nthe vast millions of devout Hindus*\\nWithin the general area known as Hinduism^ considered historically,\\nthere have been at least six very different religions or ^^types of re*\\nligions.” Each developed its own library of sacred writings and, in many\\ninstances, an\\nearlier type made a\\nsubstantial\\ncontribution\\nto\\nlater\\ndevelopments. Although each type has its distinctive features, it is pos-\\nsible to trace a clear line of growth and development from the earliest\\nnature-worship to the latest philosophic and theological teachings of\\nrecent reformers.\\nThe most primitive type, characterized by a crude nature-worship,\\nwas given literary form in the Vedas or Books of Knowledge. There\\nare four of these Vedas: the Rig~Veda, or Veda of Verses; the Yajur-\\nVeda^ or Veda of Sacred Formulas; the Sama-Veda, or Veda of Chants;\\nand the Atharva-Veda, or Veda of Charms. In these writings is to be\\nfound “a\\npoetic testament\\nof a\\npeople’s\\ncollective\\nreaction\\nto\\nthe\\nwonder and awe of existence,” They are books of the childhood of\\nHinduism and are full of childhood’s simple faith and enchantment\\nwith life, a faith that is not as yet burdened with intellectual brooding.\\nThe Vedas date from some period betw^een 2000 and 1000 b.g.\\nAfter the Hindus moved into India and conquered the country, their\\nreligion began to harden into a vast system of laws and sacred formulae\\nwhich were interpreted and enforced by a religious group of priests.\\nOut of this grew the Brahmanas or Priestlies^ extensive prose writings\\non religion. Here are many religious legends mixed with detailed in-\\nstructions as to sacrifices and religious observances. This development\\ntook place between 1000 and 800 b.g. and was characterized by the\\nrising power of the priests as a class and a decided lessening of the\\nauthority of the old Vedic gods.\\nBut Hinduism was not to remain long in the shackles of the priests.\\nGradually the Hindus’ love for philosophic speculation asserted\\nitself,\\nso that between 800 and 600 b.g, there was developed a group of writ-\\nings in which this love for speculation was given free rein. These writ-\\nings have become known as the Upanishads or Seances. Here are found\\nthe results of deep ‘‘brooding on the meaning of existence,” of calm\\nmeditation and keenness of spiritual insight. The early childlike faith\\nand the later trust in ceremonies are both gone, and in their place has\\ncome the earnest desire to explore“the infinite depths of the Soul in\\nwhich the central principle of creation is reflected.”\\nAs in so many religions, the philosophic movement within Hinduism\\nwas followed by a strong legalistic movement around 250 b.g. Thus, in\\nthe Laws of Manu\\nis to be found a code of Hindu law which aimed\\nHINDUISM\\n11\\nat setting up an institution which would be ejffective throughout genera-\\ntions. This code\\nis\\nfull of commandments and prohibitions for daily\\nliving through all the stages of\\nlife as well as a great number of wise\\nsayings and maxims.\\nOne of the greatest eras of Hinduism, in the estimation of many,\\nwas around\\n1 a.d. when there appeared the Bhagavad Gita^, or Lord^s\\nSong, This work is an expression of the devotional strain in Hinduism,\\na reformulation of the religion in terms of devotion to a personal god\\nwho will take care of everything if the worshiper will do his duty accord-\\ning to his caste and trust in God,\\nAfter the beginning of the Christian era, Hinduism entered a period\\nduring which many attempts were made to reinterpret the fundamental\\ndoctrines and beliefs in popular form. These attempts gave rise to the\\nfinal literary work of the Hindu sacred writings, the two epics\\n: Mahab-\\nharata^ or the Great Bharata War, and the Ramayana, or the Career\\nof the God Rama, and eighteen Puranas, or Ancient Tales, These docu-\\nments are an indiscriminate mixture of many features of earlier Hindu-\\nism with modern doctrines picked up from many sources. They date\\nfrom the period\\n1 to 250 a.d. Within the pattern of popular Hinduism\\nare to be found laws and regulations regarding caste, eating, idolatry,\\nsacred places and festivals, and much superstition.\\nMany attempts have been made since the beginning of the Christian\\nera to reform Hinduism and numerous leaders have come forward as\\nspearheads of these attempts. In most cases the result of their work has\\nbeen\\nlittle more than the establishment of a small sect varying only\\nslightly from the vast body of the religion. These small movements have\\nhad little or no effect upon the great stream of the religion.\\nTHE RIG-VEDA\\nOf\\nVedas, or Booh^ of Knowledge, yMch constitute the\\nsacred writings of ancient Hinduism^ the Rig-Veda, or Veda of Verses,\\nis the most important. In\\nfact,\\nthis document\\nis the oldest writing\\namong the\\nworld’s\\nliving\\nreligions,\\ndating from 2000\\nto\\n1000\\nb.g.\\nNevertheless,\\nit reveals a people who have progressed far in building a\\ncivilization and developing a culture. In\\nit\\nis\\nlittle or nothing of the\\nprimitive beliefs of savage or semi-savage people. The gods and the\\nbeliefs\\nexpressed here compare favorably\\nto\\nthose\\nof\\nthe Homeric\\nGreeks.\\nThe Rig-Veda consists of 10 books comprising a total of 1,028 hymns\\nor psalms. These hymns are most certainly the result of a long period\\nof development during which the people sang or recited them and often\\nadded to them as\\ntheir beliefs changed. Consequently, although the\\ngeneral trend\\nis that of nature-worship,\\nthere are many varieties of\\nbelief and worship among the hymns. Prayers to some 70 objects, each\\nserving as a deity, are to be found, along with affirmations of a high\\nethical idealism and psalms which equal anything in the Old Testa-\\nment.\\nWe also find mention of the caste system, with a definite statement\\ncomparing the four groups of human beings to parts of the human\\nbody.\\ni.\\n1.\\nTo Agni\\n1.\\nI LAUD\\nAgni,\\nthe\\nchosen\\npriest,\\ngod, minister of sacrifice.\\nThe hotar, lavishest of wealth.\\n2.

They date from\\npossibly 800 to 600 b.g. and are the finest results of Hindu speculation\\nupon\\nthe fundamental\\nproblems\\nthat have\\nchallenged\\nphilosophic\\nminds throughout the ages.\\nThe word Upanishad is derived from the root meaning ‘Ho sit”. The\\nHindu had time to sit and discuss these problems with his fellows. Thus\\nthe writings are connected discourses, or rather conversations, partici-\\npated in by men whose hair had grown white and who had seen their\\nsons’ sons,—the old and very wise men. One gets the impression as one\\nreads these books that much of the conversation was punctuated by\\nlong periods of silence when the speakers remained quiet, lost in thought\\ntoo deep for words.\\nThe chief problem of the Upanishads/ doimna.tmg a.nd casting its\\nglow over almost every page, is the relationship of the outer world to\\nthe inner self of man. And the conclusion reached is that they are iden-\\ntical, that the outer world is spiritual. “All is Self” is the constant theme\\nof the Upanishads, and in\\nit the Hindu believed that he had found\\na solution of all his deepest problems. The spirit which was himself was\\nalso the essence of the outer world.\\nThere are many Upanishads, or philosophic writings of this period,\\nthat are considered sacred by the Hindus. Only a few of these have been\\ntranslated into English or are available for study by Western scholars.\\nOf those available, we have chosen the Brihad-Aranyaka, the Chan-\\ndogya, the Katha, ikm Isa, and the Svetasvatara as representative of the\\ngeneral tenor of the entire development of philosophic Hinduism.\\nThe Brihad-Aranyaka\\nUpanishad\\nFirst Adhyaya\\nTHIRD BRAHMANA\\n1. There were two kinds of descend-\\nants of Prajapati, the Devas and the\\nAsuras. Now\\nthe Devas were indeed\\nthe younger, the Asuras the elder ones.\\nThe\\nDevas, who\\nwere\\nstruggling\\nin\\nthese worlds, said:\\n“Well, let us over-\\ncome the Asuras at the sacrifices\\n(the\\nJyotishtoma)\\nby means\\nof\\nthe\\nudgi-\\ntha.”\\n2. They\\nsaid\\nto\\nspeech\\n(Vach)\\n;\\n“Do\\nthou\\nsing\\nout\\nfor\\nus\\n(the\\nudgitha).”\\n“Yes,”\\nsaid\\nspeech,\\nand\\nsang\\n(the udgitha). Whatever delight\\nthere\\nis in speech, that she obtained\\nfor\\nthe Devas by\\nsinging\\n(the\\nthree\\npavamanas)\\n; but that she pronounced\\nwell\\n(in the other nine pavamanas),\\nthat was for herself. The Asuras knew:\\n“Verily, through\\nthis singer they will\\novercome\\nus.” They therefore rushed\\nat the singer and pierced her with evil.\\n18\\nHINDUISM\\nThat\\nevil\\nwhich\\nconsists\\nin\\nsaying\\nwhat is bad, that is that evil.\\n3. Then\\nthey\\n(the Devas)\\nsaid\\nto\\nbreath\\n(scent)\\n: “Do thou sing out for\\nus.”\\n“Yes,”\\nsaid\\nbreath,\\nand\\nsang.\\nWhatever\\ndelight\\nthere\\nis\\nin\\nbreath\\n(smell),\\nthat\\nhe\\nobtained\\nfor\\nthe\\nDevas by singing; but that he smelled\\nwell, that was for himself. The Asuras\\nknew:\\n“Verily,\\nthrough\\nthis\\nsinger\\nthey\\nwill overcome\\nus.” They\\nthere-\\nfore rushed at the singer, and pierced\\nhim with\\nevil. That\\nevil which\\ncon-\\nsists\\nin smelling what\\nis bad, that\\nis\\nthat evil.\\n4. Then they said to the eye: “Do\\nthou sing out for us.” “Yes,” said the\\neye, and sang. Whatever delight there\\nis in the eye, that he obtained for the\\nDevas\\nby\\nsinging;\\nbut\\nthat\\nhe saw\\nwell, that was for himself. The Asuras\\nknew:\\n“Verily,\\nthrough\\nthis\\nsinger\\nthey\\nwill overcome\\nus.” They\\nthere-\\nfore rushed at the singer, and pierced\\nhim with evil. That evil which consists\\nin seeing what is bad, that is that evil.\\n5 . Then they said to the ear: “Do\\nthou sing out for us.” “Yes,” said the\\near, and sang. Whatever delight there\\nis in the ear, that he obtained for the\\nDevas by singing; but that he heard\\nwell, that was for himself. The Asuras\\nknew:\\n“Verily,\\nthrough\\nthis\\nsinger\\nthey\\nwill overcome\\nus.” They\\nthere-\\nfore rushed at the singer, and pierced\\nhim with\\nevil. That\\nevil which con-\\nsists\\nin hearing what\\nis bad,\\nthat\\nis\\nthat\\nevil.\\n6. Then they said to the mind : “Do\\nthou sing out for us.” “Yes,” said the\\nmind,\\nand\\nsang.\\nWhatever\\ndelight\\nthere\\nis in the mind, that he obtained\\nfor the Devas by singing; but that he\\nthought well, that was for himself. The\\nAsuras\\nknew:\\n“Verily,\\nthrough\\nthis\\nsinger\\nthey\\nwill overcome\\nus.” They\\ntherefore\\nrushed\\nat\\nthe\\nsinger,\\nand\\npierced him with evil. That evil which\\nconsists in thinking what\\nis bad, that\\nis that evil.\\nThus they overwhelmed these deities\\nwith evils, thus they pierced them with\\nevil.\\n7. Then they said\\nto the breath in\\nthe mouth:\\n“Do\\nthou\\nsing\\nfor\\nus.”\\n“Yes,” said the breath, and sang. The\\nAsuras\\nknew:\\n“Verily,\\nthrough\\nthis\\nsinger\\nthey\\nwill overcome\\nus.” They\\ntherefore rushed\\nat him and pierced\\nhim with\\nevil. Now as a ball of earth\\nwill be scattered when hitting a stone,\\nthus\\nthey\\nperished,\\nscattered\\nin\\nall\\ndirections. Hence the Devas\\nrose, the\\nAsuras\\nfell. He who knows\\nthis,\\nrises\\nby his Self, and the enemy who hates\\nhim falls.\\n8. Then\\nthey\\n(the\\nDevas)\\nsaid:\\n“Where was he then who thus stuck\\nto us?” It was (the breath) within the\\nmouth\\n(asye\\n’ntar),\\nand\\ntherefore\\ncalled Ayasya; he was the sap\\n(rasa)\\nof\\nthe\\nlimbs\\n(anga),\\nand\\ntherefore\\ncalled Angirasa.\\n9. That\\ndeity was\\ncalled Dur,\\nbe-\\ncause death was far\\n(duran) from\\nit.\\nFrom him who knows\\nthis, death\\nis\\nfar off.\\n10. That\\ndeity,\\nafter having taken\\naway\\nthe\\nevil\\nof\\nthose\\ndeities,\\nviz.\\ndeath, sent\\nit to where the end of the\\nquarters of the earth\\nis. There he de-\\nposited their sins. Therefore let no one\\ngo to a man, let no one go to the end\\n(of the quarters of the earth), that he\\nmay\\nnot meet\\nthere\\nwith\\nevil,\\nwith\\ndeath.\\n11. That\\ndeity,\\nafter having taken\\naway\\nthe\\nevil\\nof\\nthose\\ndeities,\\nviz.\\ndeath, carried them beyond death,\\n12. He\\ncarried speech\\nacross\\nfirst.\\nWhen speech had become freed from\\ndeath,\\nit became\\n(what\\nit had been\\nbefore) Agni\\n(fire). That Agni, after\\nhaving stepped beyond death, shines.\\n13. Then he carried breath\\n(scent)\\nacross. When breath had become freed\\nfrom\\ndeath,\\nit became Vayu\\n(air).\\nThat Vayu,\\nafter having stepped be-\\nyond death, blows.\\n14. Then he carried the eye across.\\nWhen the eye had become freed from\\ndeath,\\nit became\\nAditya\\n(the\\nsun).\\nTHE UPANISHADS\\n19\\nThat Aditya, after having stepped be-\\nyond death, burns.\\n15. Then he carried the ear across.\\nWhen the ear had become freed from\\ndeath, it became the quarters (space).\\nThese are our quarters\\n(space), which\\nhave stepped beyond death.\\n»\\n16. Then\\nhe\\ncarried\\nthe\\nmind\\nacross. When\\nthe mind had become\\nfreed from death, it became the moon\\n(Chandramas).\\nThat\\nmoon,\\nafter\\nhaving stepped beyond\\ndeath,\\nshines.\\nThus does that deity carry him, who\\nknows this, across death.\\n17. Then breath\\n(vital), by singing,\\nobtained for himself eatable food. For\\nwhatever\\nfood\\nis\\neaten,\\nis\\neaten by\\nbreath alone, and in\\nit breath\\nrests.\\nThe Devas said:\\n“Verily, thus\\nfar,\\nwhatever food\\nthere\\nis, thou\\nhast by\\nsinging\\nacquired\\nit\\nfor\\nthyself. Now\\ntherefore give us a share in that food.”\\nHe said: “You, there, enter into me,”\\nThey said “Yes,” and entered\\nall into\\nhim. Therefore whatever food is eaten\\nby breath, by\\nit the other senses are\\nsatisfied.\\n18.\\nIf a man knows\\nthis, then his\\nown relations come to him in the same\\nmanner; he becomes\\ntheir supporter,\\ntheir\\nchief leader,\\ntheir strong\\nruler.\\nAnd\\nif ever anyone tries to oppose one\\nwho\\nis\\npossessed\\nof such\\nknowledge\\namong his own relatives, then he will\\nnot be\\nable\\nto\\nsupport\\nhis own\\nbe-\\nlongings. But he who follows the man\\nwho\\nis possessed\\nof such knowledge,\\nand who with his permission wishes to\\nsupport those whom he has to support,\\nhe indeed will be able to support his\\nown belongings.\\n19. He was called Ayasya Angirasa,\\nfor he\\nis the sap\\n(rasa)\\nof the limbs\\n(anga). Verily, breath is the sap of the\\nlimbs.\\nYes,\\nbreath\\nis\\nthe\\nsap\\nof the\\nlimbs. Therefore from whatever limb\\nbreath goes away,\\nthat limb\\nwithers,\\nfor\\nbreath\\nverily\\nis\\nthe\\nsap\\nof\\nthe\\nlimbs.\\n20. He\\n(breath)\\nis also Brihaspati,\\nfor speech\\nis Brihati\\n(Rigveda), and\\nhe\\nis her lord ; therefore he\\nis Brihas-\\npati.\\n21. He (breath)\\nis also Brahmanas-\\npati,\\nfor speech\\nis Brahman\\n(Yajur-\\nveda), and he\\nis her\\nlord;\\ntherefore\\nhe is Brahmanaspati.\\nHe\\n(breath)\\nis\\nalso\\nSaman\\n(the\\nUdgitha), for speech is Saman (Sama-\\nveda), and\\nthat\\nis both\\nspeech\\n(sa)\\nand breath (ama)\\n. This is why Saman\\nis called Saman.\\n22. Or because he\\nis equal (sama)\\nto a grub, equal to a gnat, equal to an\\nelephant, equal to these three worlds,\\nnay, equal\\nto\\nthis universe, therefore\\nhe\\nis Saman. He who thus knows this\\nSaman,\\nobtains\\nunion\\nand\\noneness\\nwith Saman.\\n23. He (breath)\\nis Udgitha. Breath\\nverily\\nis\\nUt,\\nfor by breath\\nthis\\nuni-\\nverse\\nis\\nupheld\\n(uttabdha)\\n;\\nand\\nspeech is Githa, song. And because he\\nis ut and githa, therefore he\\n(breath)\\nis Udgitha.\\n24. And thus Brahmadatta Chaiki-\\ntaneya\\n(the grandson\\nof Chikitana),\\nwhile\\ntaking\\nSoma\\n(rajan),\\nsaid:\\n“May this Soma strike my head off, if\\nAyasya Angirasa sang another Udgitha\\nthan this. He sang it indeed as speech\\nand breath.”\\n25. He\\nwho\\nknows\\nw’’hat\\nis\\nthe\\nproperty of\\nthis Saman, obtains prop-\\nerty. Now\\nverily\\nits property\\nis\\ntone\\nonly.\\nTherefore\\nlet a\\npriest, who\\nis\\ngoing\\nto perform the\\nsacrificial work\\nof a Sama-singer, desire that his voice\\nmay have a good\\ntone, and\\nlet him\\nperform the sacrifice with a voice that\\nis\\nin\\ngood\\ntone.\\nTherefore\\npeople\\n(who want a\\npriest)\\nfor a\\nsacrifice,\\nlook out for one who possesses a good\\nvoice, as for one who possesses prop-\\nerty. He who thus knows what\\nis the\\nproperty of that Saman, obtains prop-\\nerty.\\n26. He who knows what is the gold\\nof\\nthat\\nSaman,\\nobtains\\ngold.\\nNow\\nverily\\nits gold\\nis tone\\nonly. He who\\nthus knows what\\nis\\nthe gold\\nof that\\nSaman, obtains gold.\\n20\\nHINDUISM\\n27. He who knows what is the sup-\\nport of that Saman, he\\nis supported.\\nNow verily\\nits support is speech only.\\nFor,\\nas\\nsupported\\nin\\nspeech,\\nthat\\nbreath\\nis sung\\nas that Saman. Some\\nsay the support is in food.\\nNext\\nfollows\\nthe\\nAbhyaroha\\n(the\\nascension)\\nof\\nthe\\nPavamana\\nverses.\\nVerily the Prastotri begins to sing the\\nSaman, and when he begins, then let\\nhim (the sacrificer)\\nrecite these (three\\nYajus-verses)\\n:\\n“Lead me from the unreal to the\\nreal! Lead me from darkness to light!\\nLead me from death to immortaiityr’\\nNow when he says, “Lead me from\\nthe unreal to the\\nreal,’’ the unreal\\nis\\nverily death, the real immortality. He\\ntherefore\\nsays, “Lead me from death\\nto immortality, make me immortal,”\\nWhen he says, “Lead me from dark-\\nness to light,” darkness is verily death,\\nlight\\nimmortality. He\\ntherefore\\nsays,\\n“Lead me from death to immortality,\\nmake me immortal.”\\nWhen he says, “Lead me from death\\nto immortality,” there is nothing there,\\nas\\nit were, hidden\\n(obscure, requiring\\nexplanation).\\n28. Next\\ncome\\nthe\\nother\\nStotras\\nwith which the priest may obtain food\\nfor himself by singing them. Therefore\\nlet the\\nsacrificer, while\\nthese\\nStotras\\nare being sung, ask for a boon, what-\\never desire he may desire. An Udgatri\\npriest who knows\\nthis obtains by\\nhis\\nsinging whatever desire he may desire\\neither for himself or for the sacrificer.\\nThis (knowledge) indeed is called the\\nconqueror of the worlds. He who thus\\nknows this Saman, for him there is no\\nfear of his not being admitted to the\\nworlds.\\nSecond Adhyaya\\nFIRST BRAHMANA\\n1.\\nThere\\nwas\\nformerly\\nthe\\nproud\\nGargya Balaki, a man of great reading.\\nHe said to Ajatasatru of Kasi, “Shall\\nI tell you Brahman?” Ajatasatru said :\\n“We give a thousand\\n(cows)\\nfor that\\nspeech (of yours), for verily all people\\nrun away, saying, Janaka (the king of\\nMithila)\\nis our father (patron) .”\\n2. Gargya said : “The person that is\\nin the sun, that I adore as Brahman.”\\nAjatasatru said\\nto him:\\n“No, no! Do\\nnot speak to me on this.\\nI adore him\\nverily as the supreme, the head of all\\nbeings,\\nthe\\nking. Whoso\\nadores him\\nthus, becomes\\nsupreme,\\nthe head\\nof\\nall beings, a king.”\\n3. Gargya\\nsaid :\\n“The person\\nthat\\nis in the moon\\n( and in the mind ) that\\nI adore as Brahman.” Ajatasatru said\\nto him: “No, no! Do not speak to me\\non this. I adore him verily as the great,\\nclad\\nin white\\nraiment,\\nas Soma, the\\nking. Whoso adores him\\nthus, Soma\\nis poured\\nout and poured\\nforth\\nfor\\nhim day by day, and his food does not\\nfail.”\\n4. Gargya said : **The person that is\\nin\\nthe\\nlightning\\n(and\\nin\\nthe heart),\\nthat I adore as Brahman.” Ajatasatru\\nsaid\\nto him:\\n“No, no! Do not speak\\nto me on this. I adore him verily as the\\nluminous. Whoso adores him thus, be-\\ncomes luminous, and his offspring be-\\ncomes luminous.”\\n5. Gargya said: “The person that is\\nin the ether (and in the ether of the\\nheart),\\nthat\\nI\\nadore\\nas\\nBrahman.”\\nAjatasatru said to him:\\n“No, no! Do\\nnot speak to me on this.\\nI adore him\\nas what\\nis\\nfull, and quiescent. Whoso\\nadores him\\nthus, becomes\\nfilled with\\noffspring and\\ncattle, and his offspring\\ndoes not cease from this world.”\\n6. Gargya\\nsaid:\\n“The person\\nthat\\nis\\nin the wind\\n(and\\nin\\nthe breath),\\nthat I adore as Brahman.” Ajatasatru\\nsaid to him: “No, no! Do not speak to\\nme\\non\\nthis.\\nI\\nadore him\\nas\\nIndra\\nVaikuntha, as the unconquerable arm\\n(of the Maruts). Whoso adores him\\nthus, becomes\\nvictorious,\\nunconquer-\\nable, conquering his enemies.”\\n7. Gargya said : “The person that is\\nin the\\nfire (and in the heart), that\\nI\\nTHE UPANISHADS\\n21\\nadore as Brahman.” Ajatasatru said to\\nhim: “No, no! Do not speak to me on\\nthis.\\nI adore him as powerful. Whoso\\nadores\\nhim\\nthus,\\nbecomes\\npowerful,\\nand\\nhis\\noffspring becomes powerful.”\\n8. Gargya said: “The person that is\\nin\\nthe\\nwater\\n(in\\nseed,\\nand\\nin\\nthe\\nheart),\\nthat\\nI\\nadore\\nas\\nBrahman.”\\nAjatasatru said to him:\\n“No, no! Do\\nnot speak to me on\\nthis.\\nI adore him\\nas likeness. Whoso adores him thus, to\\nhim cbmes what is likely\\n(or proper),\\nnot what\\nis improper; what\\nis born\\nfrom him is like unto him,”\\n9. Gargya\\nsaid:\\n“The person that\\nis in the mirror, that I adore as Brah-\\nman.”\\nAjatasatru\\nsaid\\nto him:\\n“No,\\nno!

Gargya\\nsaid:\\n“The sound that\\nfollows a man while he moves, that I\\nadore as Brahman.” Ajatasatru said to\\nhim:\\n“No,\\nno! Do not speak\\nto me\\non\\nthis.\\nI\\nadore him\\nverily\\nas\\nlife.\\nWhoso adores him thus, he reaches his\\nfull age in this world, breath does not\\nleave him before the time.”\\n11. Gargya said: “The person that\\nis in space, that I adore as Brahman.”\\nAjatasatru said to him:\\n“No, no! Do\\nnot speak to me on\\nthis. I adore him\\nverily as the second who never leaves\\nus. Whoso adores him\\nthus, becomes\\npossessed of a second, his party is not\\ncut off from him.”\\n12. Gargya said:\\n“The person that\\nconsists of the shadow, that I adore as\\nBrahman,”\\nAjatasatru\\nsaid\\nto\\nhim:\\n“No, no! Do not speak to me on this. I\\nadore\\nhim\\nverily\\nas\\ndeath.\\nWhoso\\nadores him thus, he reaches his whole\\nage in this world, death does not ap-\\nproach him before the time.”\\n13. Gargya said: “The person that\\nis in the body, that\\nI adore as Brah-\\nman.”\\nAjatasatru\\nsaid\\nto him:\\n“No,\\nno! Do\\nnot\\nspeak\\nto me on\\nthis.\\nI\\nadore him verily as embodied.

Ajatasatru\\nsaid:\\n“Thus\\nfar\\nonly?”\\n“Thus\\nfar\\nonly,”\\nhe\\nreplied.\\nAjatasatru\\nsaid:\\n“This does not\\nsuf-\\nfice to know\\nit\\n(the true Brahman).”\\nGargya replied : “Then let me come to\\nyou, as a pupil.”\\n15. Ajatasatru\\nsaid:\\n“Verily,\\nit\\nis\\nunnatural\\nthat\\na\\nBrahmana\\nshould\\ncome\\nto a Kshatriya, hoping that he\\nshould\\ntell him\\nthe Brahman.

He called him\\nby these names, “Thou, great one, clad\\nin white raiment, Soma, king.” He did\\nnot\\nrise. Then rubbing him with his\\nhand, he woke him, and he arose.\\n16. Ajatasatru\\nsaid:\\n“When\\nthis\\nman was thus asleep, where was then\\nthe person (purusha), the intelligent?\\nand from whence did he\\nthus come\\nback?” Gargya did not know this.\\n17.

And\\nthat\\ncouple\\nis\\njoined\\nto-\\ngether in the syllable Om, When two\\npeople come together, they fulfil each\\nother’s desire.\\n7. Thus,\\nhe\\nwho\\nknowing\\nthis,\\nmeditates on\\nthe\\nsyllable\\n(Om),\\nthe\\nudgitha, becomes indeed a\\nfulfiiler of\\ndesires.\\nTHE UPANISHADS\\n31\\n8. That syllable\\nis a syllable of per-\\ninission, for whenever we permit any-\\nthing, we say Om, yes. Now permission\\nis\\ngratification. He who knowing this\\nmeditates on\\nthe\\nsyllable (Om) ,\\nthe\\nudgitha, becomes indeed a gratifier of\\ndesires.\\n9. By that\\nsyllable does the\\nthree-\\nfold\\nknowledge\\n( the\\nsacrifice,\\nmore\\nparticularly\\nthe\\nsoma-sacrifice,\\nas\\nfounded on the three vedas)\\nproceed.\\nWhen\\nthe Adhvaryu\\npriest\\ngives an\\norder, he\\nsays Om. When\\nthe\\nHotri\\npriest recites, he says Om. When the\\nUdgatri priest sings, he says Om—all\\nfor\\nthe\\nglory\\nof\\nthat\\nsyllable.\\nThe\\nthreefold\\nknowledge\\n(the\\nsacrifice)\\nproceeds by the greatness of that syl-\\nlable\\n(the\\nvital\\nbreaths), and by\\nits\\nessence\\n( the oblations )\\n10. Now therefore it would seem to\\nfollow,\\nthat both he who knows\\nthis\\n(the true meaning of the syllable Om),\\nand\\nhe who\\ndoes\\nnot,\\nperform\\nthe\\nsame\\nsacrifice. But\\nthis\\nis not\\nso, for\\nknowledge and ignorance are dijfierent.\\nThe\\nsacrifice which a man performs\\nwith knowledge, faith, and the upani-\\nshad\\nis more\\npowerful.\\nThis\\nis\\nthe\\nfull account of the syllable Om.\\nThird TrapATHAK.A\\nFOURTEENTH KHANDA\\n1.\\nAll\\nthis\\nis Brahman\\n(n.).

It cannot be their union either,\\nbecause\\nthat\\nis\\nnot\\nself-dependent,\\nand the\\nself also\\nis powerless, because\\nthere is (independent of him) a cause\\nof good and evil.\\n3. The sages, devoted to meditation\\nand\\nconcentration,\\nhave\\nseen\\nthe\\npower belonging to God himself, hid-\\nden in\\nits own qualities\\n(guna). He,\\nbeing\\none,\\nsuperintends\\nall\\nthose\\ncauses, time, self, and the rest.\\n4.

We meditate on the river whose\\nwater\\nconsists\\nof\\nthe\\nfive\\nstreams,\\nwhich is wild and winding with its five\\nsprings, whose waves are the five vital\\nbreaths, whose\\nfountain head\\nis\\nthe\\nmind, the course of the\\nfive kinds\\nof\\nperceptions.

In\\nthat\\nvast\\nBrahma-wheel,\\nin\\nwhich all things live and rest, the bird\\nflutters about, so long as he thinks that\\nthe self (in him)\\nis different from the\\n40\\nHIHDUISM\\nmover\\n(the god, the lord)\\n. When he\\nhas been blessed by him, then he gains\\nimmortality,\\n7. But what is praised (in the upan-\\nishads)\\nis the Highest Brahman, and\\nin\\nit there\\nis the\\ntriad. The Highest\\nBrahman\\nis the safe support,\\nit\\nis im-\\nperishable.\\nThe\\nBrahma - students,\\nwhen they have known what is within\\nthis (world), are devoted and merged\\nin the Brahman, free from birth,\\n8. The Lord\\n(isa)\\nsupports all this\\ntogether,\\nthe\\nperishable and\\nthe im-\\nperishable, the developed and the un-\\ndeveloped. The \\'(living)\\nself, not being\\na\\nlord,\\nis bound, because he has\\nto\\nenjoy\\n(the fruits of works)\\n; but when\\nhe has known the god\\n(deva), he\\nis\\nfreed from all fetters.\\n9.

When a\\nman\\nfinds\\nout\\nthese\\nthree,\\nthat\\nis\\nBrahma.\\n10. That which\\nis perishable\\nis the\\nPradhana (the first), the immortal aifd\\nimperishable\\nis\\nHara. The\\none god\\nrules\\nthe\\nperishable\\n(the pradhana)\\nand the (living)\\nself. From meditating\\non him, from joining him, from becom-\\ning\\none\\nwith\\nhim\\nthere\\nis\\nfurther\\ncessation of all illusion in the end.\\n11. When\\nthat god\\nis known,\\nall\\nfetters fall off, sufferings are destroyed,\\nand birth and death cease. From medi-\\ntating\\non him\\nthere\\narises,\\non\\nthe\\ndissolution of the body, the third states\\nthat of universal lordship ; but he only\\nwho is alone, is satisfied.\\n12. This,\\nwhich\\nrests\\neternally\\nwithin the self, should be known;, and\\nbeyond\\nthis\\nnot\\nanything\\nhas\\nto be\\nknown. By knowing\\nthe\\nenjoyer,\\nthe\\nenjoyed, and the ruler, everything has\\nbeen declared to be threefold, and this\\nis Brahman.\\n13. As\\nthe\\nform\\nof\\nfire,\\nwhile\\nit\\nexists in the under-wood,\\nis not seen,\\nnor is its seed destroyed, but\\nit has to\\nbe seized again and again by means of\\nthe stick and the under-wood, so it is\\nin both\\ncases, and the Self has to be\\nseized\\nin\\nthe body by means\\nof\\nthe\\npranava (the syllable Om).\\n14. By making his body the under-\\nwood, and the syllable Om the upper-\\nwood, man, after repeating the drill of\\nmeditation,\\nwill\\nperceive\\nthe\\nbright\\ngod, like the spark hidden in the wood.\\n15. As\\noil\\nin\\nseeds,\\nas\\nbutter\\nin\\ncream, as water in (dry)\\nriver-beds, as\\nfire in wood, so is the Self seized within\\nthe self, if man looks for him by truth-\\nfulness and penance\\n16.\\n(If he\\nlooks)\\nfor the\\nSelf that\\npervades everything, as butter\\nis con-\\ntained in milk, and the roots whereof\\nare self-knowledge and penance. That\\nis\\nthe Brahman taught by the upan-\\nishad.\\nThird Adhvaya\\n1. The snarer who rules alone by his\\npowers, who rules all the worlds by his\\npowers, who is one and the same, while\\nthings arise and exist—they who know\\nthis are immortal.\\n2. For there is one Rudra only, they\\ndo not allow a second, who rules\\nall\\nthe worlds by his powers. He\\nstands\\nbehind\\nall\\npersons, and\\nafter having\\ncreated\\nall worlds\\nhe,\\' the\\nprotector,\\nrolls it up at the end of time.\\n3. That one\\ngod, having\\nhis\\neyes,\\nhis face, his arms, and his feet in every\\nplace,\\nwhen\\nproducing\\nheaven\\nand\\nearth,\\nforges them\\ntogether with\\nhis\\narms and his wings.\\n4. He, the creator and supporter of\\nthe\\ngods, Rudra,\\nthe\\ngreat\\nseer,\\nthe\\nlord of all, he who formerly gave birth\\nto Hiranyagarbha, may he endow us\\nwith good thoughts.\\n5. O\\nRudra,\\nthou\\ndweller\\nin\\nthe\\nmountains,\\nlook upon\\nus\\nwith\\nthat\\nmost\\nblessed form\\nof\\nthine which\\nis\\nTHE UPANISHADS\\n41\\nauspicious,\\nnot\\nterrible,\\nand\\nreveals\\nno evil!\\n6. O\\nlord\\nof the mountains, make\\nlucky that arrow which thou, a dweller\\nin the mountains, boldest in thy hand\\nto shoot. Do not hurt man or beast!\\n7. Those who know beyond this the\\nHigh Brahman, the vast, hidden in the\\nbodies of\\nall creatures, and alone en-\\nveloping everything, as the Lord, they\\nbecome immortal.\\n8.\\nI know that great person (puru-\\nsha) of sunlike lustre beyond the dark-\\nness. A man who knows him\\ntruly,\\npasses over death;\\nthere\\nis no other\\npath to go.\\n9. This whole universe\\nis\\nfilled by\\nthis person (purusha) , to whom there\\nis nothing superior, from whom there\\nis nothing different, than whom there\\nis\\nnothing\\nsmaller\\nor\\nlarger,\\nwho\\nstands alone,\\nfixed\\nlike a\\ntree in the\\nsky.\\n10.

That\\nBhagavat\\nexists\\nin\\nthe\\nfaces, the heads, the necks of\\nall, he\\ndwells in the cave (of the heart)\\nof all\\nbeings, he\\nis\\nall-pervading,\\ntherefore\\nhe is the omnipresent Siva.\\n12. That person\\n(purusha)\\nis\\nthe\\ngreat lord; he\\nis\\nthe mover of\\nexist-\\nence, he possesses that purest power of\\nreaching everything; he\\nis light, he\\nis\\nundecaying.\\n13. The\\nperson\\n(purusha),\\nnot\\nlarger than a thumb, dwelling within,\\nalways dwelling\\nin the heart of man,\\nis perceived by the heart, the thought,\\nthe mind; they who know\\nit become\\nimmortal.\\n14. The person\\n(purusha)\\nwith a\\nthousand\\nheads,\\na\\nthousand\\neyes, a\\nthousand\\nfeet, having compassed\\nthe\\nearth on every side, extends beyond it\\nby ten fingers’ breadth.\\n15. That person alone (purusha)\\nis\\nall\\nthis, what has been and what will\\nbe; he\\nis also the lord of immortality;\\nhe is whatever grows by food.\\n16.\\nIts hands and\\nfeet\\nare\\nevery-\\nwhere,\\nits\\neyes and head\\nare\\nevery-\\nwhere,\\nits\\nears\\nare\\neverywhere,\\nit\\nstands encompassing\\nall in the world.\\n17. Separate\\nfrom\\nall\\nthe\\nsenses,\\nyet\\nreflecting\\nthe\\nqualities\\nof\\nall the\\nsenses, it is the lord and ruler of all, it\\nis the great refuge of all.\\n18. The embodied spirit within the\\ntown with nine gates, the bird, flutters\\noutwards, the ruler of the whole world,\\nof all that rests and of all that moves.\\n19. Grasping without hands, hasting\\nwithout feet, he sees without eyes, he\\nhears without ears. He knows what can\\nbe known, but no one knows him; they\\ncall him\\nthe\\nfirst,\\nthe\\ngreat\\nperson\\n(purusha).\\n20. The\\nSelf,\\nsmaller than\\nsmall,\\ngreater than\\ngreat,\\nis hidden\\nin\\nthe\\nheart of the creature. A man who has\\nleft all grief behind, sees the majesty,\\nthe Lord, the passionless, by the grace\\nof the creator (the Lord).\\n21.\\nI know this undecaying, ancient\\none,\\nthe\\nself of\\nall\\nthings, being\\nin-\\nfinite and omnipresent. They declare\\nthat in him all birth is stopped, for the\\nBrahma-students proclaim him\\nto be\\neternal.\\nFourth Adhyaya\\n1. He, the sun, without any colour,\\nwho with set purpose by means of his\\npower\\n(sakti)\\nproduces\\nendless\\ncol-\\nours, in whom\\nall this comes together\\nin the beginning, and comes asunder\\nin the end—^may he, the god, endow us\\nwith good thoughts.\\n2.

But when he sees\\nthe\\nother\\nlord\\n(isa)\\ncontented, and\\nknows\\nhis glory, then his\\ngrief passes\\naway.\\n8.

Those who\\nthrough\\nheart and mind know him\\nthus abiding in the heart, become im-\\nmortal.\\n21. “Thou art unborn,” with these\\nwords some one comes near\\nto\\nthee,\\ntrembling.

In it we find a definite doctrine of the\\nimmortality of the soul, the idea that the God\\nis able to assume the\\nform of man to teach men His ways, an offer of universal salvation to\\nsinners, even to low-caste women, and at the same time strict adherence\\nto the ancient caste system.\\nThe Bhagavad-Gita has been translated by more than a half hundred\\nscholars and as we come to understand\\nits message,\\nits place among\\nthe\\nmasterpieces\\nof\\ndevotional\\nliterature becomes more and more\\nsecure.\\nLesson the First\\nARJUNA spake:—\\n28. \"As\\nI\\nlook, O\\nKrishna, upon\\nthese kinsfolk meeting for battle,\\n29.

He whose mind\\nis undismayed\\nin pain, who is freed from longings for\\npleasure,\\nfrom whom\\npassion,\\nfear,\\nand wrath haveffied, is called a man of\\nabiding prudence, a saintly man.\\n57. He who\\nis without affection for\\naught, and whatever\\nfair or foul for-\\ntune may betide neither rejoices in\\nit\\nnor loathes\\nit, has wisdom\\nabidingly\\nset.\\n58. When such a one draws in\\nhis\\nsense-instruments\\naltogether from the\\nobjects\\nof the sense-instruments,\\nas a\\ntortoise draws in\\nits limbs, he has wis-\\ndom abidingly set.\\n59.

To-\\nday only about 100,000 followers of Zoroaster are in existence, scat-\\ntered throughout Persia and India.\\nA great many of the concepts found both in the Old and the New\\nTestament stem directly from Zoroastrianism, though the religion itself\\nis not mentioned anywhere in the Bible. Many of the kings of Persia\\nmentioned in the Old Testament were Zoroastrians. Among these are\\nJosiah, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Ahasuerus, and Darius. The Magi, wise men\\nfrom the East, who came to the manger to see the new-born Jesus, were\\nZoroastrian\\npriests. Although many early religions exerted influence\\nover the religion of the Old and New Testaments, Zoroastrianism is the\\nonly one remaining alive today.\\nSatan, as described and accepted in the Bible, was introduced from\\nZoroastrianism, as was also the whole elaborate scheme of angels and\\ndemons, of the Saviour who was to come, and the doctrines of resur-\\nrection and final judgment as well as the conception of a future life to\\nbe lived in “Paradise’*.\\nZoroastrianism was the first religion to teach universality. It held that\\nthe salvation offered by its god, Ahura Mazda, was not to be confined\\nto the few, but was for everyone who would come to its knowledge and\\nunderstanding. However, this universality has been abandoned by the\\nmore modern followers of Zoroaster so that today the religion is heredi-\\ntary, a fact which accounts for the shrinking number of its adherents.\\nZoroaster,\\n(also known as Zarathustra) the founder of Zoroastrian-\\nism, or the religion of the Parsis, probably lived in the Seventh Cen-\\ntury\\nB.G. However, in Zoroastrianism tradition there are\\nstories that\\nwould date his birth as early as 6000 b.c. This tradition\\nis also filled\\nwith stories of miracles and of divine prophecies of his birth and deeds.\\nAt 15 years of age Zoroaster dedicated himself to the religious life and,\\n67\\n68\\nZOROASTRIANISM\\nwhen 30, he\\nis believed to have had a direct call into the presence of\\nAhura .\\'Mazda to receive his blessing and instractions for\\' founding the\\nreligion. From this time the young man continued to confer with Ahura\\nMazda and to preach a universal progressive religion among the agri-\\ncultural communities of Pars in Persia.\\nThe story of Zoroaster\\'s\\nlife\\nis filled with accounts of his magnetic\\npreaching, temptations which he successfully resisted, miracles, and con-\\nstant\\nsacrifies. During middle\\nlife Zoroaster was able to convert the\\n*king, Vistaspa, and his brother, a counsellor, and the grand vizier. This\\ngave his work official sanction and led to his marriage to the daughter of\\nthe king’s counsellor. Throughout the remainder of his\\nlife Zoroaster\\nworked in close harmony with the government and was able to use its\\npower to spread his teachings and obtain converts. The religion became\\nthe official faith of the government and was employed to sanction the\\nmilitaristic nationalism of Persia during these years.\\nThe sacred books of Zoroastrianism are known under the general title\\nof Avesta^ meaning ‘‘knowledge”. Those parts of the Avesta remaining\\ntoday are arranged in five large groups. The earliest and most important\\nsection is the Yasna, meaning worship or sacrifice. Interlaced within the\\nAvesta are\\n17 psalms, or Gathas. These psalms are believed to have\\nbeen written by Zoroaster himself. Another small section of the Avesta\\nis the Visperady a less important liturgical work often employed in wor-\\nship services. The Vendidad\\nis- a priestly code of laws governing cere-\\nmonies and contains much material about the history, cosmology, and\\ntheology of the religion. Other sections of the Zoroastrian scriptures\\nare the YashtSy or worship hymns, and the Khorda-AvestUy or Little\\nAvestay a devotional handbook used by all true Zoroastrians,\\nAlthough Persia began a period of conquest and expansion under\\nkings devoted\\nto Zoroastrianism and continued\\nthis for some\\ntime,\\neventually it was conquered by the Arabs, followers of Mohammed, and\\nmost of the Zoroastrians were converted\\nto\\nthis new\\nreligion\\nafter\\n650 A.D. Today Zoroastrians are a small group scattered throughout the\\nworld. Many of the most influential citizens of India are Zoroastrians,\\nand the charitable works of these people are great.\\nTHE YASNA\\nTT^ Jasna is the most important liturgy of the followers of Zoroaster.\\nHere\\nis\\nto be found confession, invocation, prayer, exhortation, and\\npraise combined,\\nas in any series of liturgies. The various fragments\\ncomposing this work were selected from writings of many ages and are\\ncomposed in many different literary forms. The present arrangement of\\nthese fragments is of very ancient origin; however, the work as it now\\nstands was not in existence during the earliest periods of Zoroastrianism\\nbut took form much later as the religion began to crystallize into a set\\npattern. The word Yasna means “worship including sacrifice”.\\nI,2 1:\\nIf\\nI\\nhave\\noffended\\nthee,\\nwhether by thought, or word, or deed,\\nwhether by act of will, or without in-\\ntent or wish, I earnestly make up the\\ndeficiency of this in praise to thee.\\nIf\\nI have caused decrease in that which\\nis Thy\\nYasna,\\nand Thy homage,\\nI\\nannounce (and celebrate) to thee (the\\nmore for this)\\n!\\n10,16: To five do I belong, to five\\nothers do\\nI not; of the good thought\\nam I, of the evil am I not; of the good\\nword am I, of the evil am I not; of the\\ngood deed am\\nI, and of the evil, not.\\nTo Obedience am\\nI\\ngiven, and\\nto\\ndeaf disobedience, not; to the saint do\\nI belong, and to the wicked, not; and\\nso from this on to the ending shall be\\nthe\\nspirits* parting.\\nII, 17-18:\\nI celebrate my praise for\\ngood thoughts, good words, and good\\ndeeds\\nfor my thoughts, my speeches,\\nand\\n(my)\\nactions.\\nWith\\nchanting\\npraises\\nI\\npresent\\nall good\\nthoughts,\\ngood words, and good deeds, and with\\nrejection I repudiate all evil thoughts,\\nand words, and deeds.

The other two are\\nConfucianism and Buddhism. However, there are many who maintain\\nthat it should not be classed as a religion at all. Others point out that\\nit was originally simply a way of ethical living and was not organized\\nas a religion until late in its history, near the opening of the Christian\\nera.\\n\\'\\n\\'\\nToday there are approximately forty million adherents of this faith,\\nmost of them being in China. Japan and a few other areas of the East\\nhave\\nfelt\\nits influence\\nslightly, but\\nits most\\nvital influence remains\\namong the Chinese, where it has become mingled with other religions\\nand doctrinal teachings.\\nTaoism, according to tradition, was founded by a humble Chinese\\nknown at Lao-tze, who lived between 604 and 517 b.c. Scholars point\\nout, however, that Lao-tze was actually the crystallizer of a philosophy\\nwhich had existed in China for many centuries before his birth.\\nLao-tze was bom about\\nfifty\\nyears\\nbefore Confucius,\\nin Honan\\nprovince\\nof Central\\nChina. He was a contemporary\\nof Zoroaster,\\nMahavira, Buddha, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. His was indeed an age of\\ngreat religious movements in the East. It is recorded that when Con-\\nfucius was about thirty years of age he visited the “Venerable Phi-\\nlosopher” and was greatly influenced by his wealth of knowledge and\\nunderstanding.\\nLao-tze held various public offices, chief of which was keeper of the\\narchives at the court of the Chinese dynasty of Chou. However, his\\nchief concern was with teaching and attaining to the virtues of the Tao.\\nFundamental to all his teaching was the idea that the highest life con-\\nsisted in following the divine Way, or Tao^ of the universe. He was\\nconstantly emphasizing, both through his teachings and his living, that\\na person should return good for evil at all times. But, though passion-\\nately concerned with the Tao, Lao-tze did nothing about the world,\\nseeking rather to retire from it and spend his time in contemplation.\\n79\\n80\\nTAOISM\\nIt was long after Lao-tze’s death that his followers began\\nto look\\nupon him as worthy of worship. But gradually\\nthis man became the\\nsymbol of divinity, and miracle stories grew up about his memory. In\\n156 A.D, state sacrifices were made to him. There arose a theory of his\\nimmaculate conception, of his being born an old man with white hair\\nand great wisdom after being carried in his mother’s womb for seventy\\nyears.\\nOf the sacred writings of Taoism, we have chosen for consideration\\nthe Tao Teh King zud. the Writings of Kwang-Tze, The former is the\\nchief literary treasure of the religion, whereas the latter illustrates the\\ntype of writing which was done by later followers\\nof Lao-tze. Both\\nworks give one the flavor of Taoism and something of its teachings.\\nThe history of Taoism reveals\\nit in constant antagonism to Con-\\nfucianism.\\nIt also was violently opposed to Buddhism when the latter\\ncame on the Chinese scene. Although several Chinese Emperors have\\nbeen favorable to Taoism, it has never been the dominant faith of this\\nvast nation. In 212 b.c. the Emperor Shi Hwang-ti accepted Taoism,\\nburned Gonfucian books, and sent an expedition\\nto fairy islands to\\nsearch\\nfor\\nthe\\nherb\\nof\\nimmortality.\\nThis was\\nfollowed\\nabout two\\nhundred years later by the attempt on the part of leading Taoists to\\ncompound a\\npill of immortality. Then, in the seventh century of the\\nChristian era, Lao-tze was made a saint and his works were included\\namong subjects for government examinations. Throughout all this time\\nTaoism was producing a group of doctors who claimed to cure diseases\\nby magic. These came into conflict with the government and were often\\ncondemned by official decree.\\nModern Taoism is a very different religion. Most of the fine teachings\\nof Lao-tze and his followers have been disregarded and in their place\\nhave come polytheism, demonology, witchcraft, and occultism.\\nTHE TAO TEH KING\\nThis dGCument is the most important literary treasure of the Taoists.\\nMost scholars agree that the material comes direct from Lao-tze and\\nwas possibly written by him in much the same form as we now have it.\\nTranslating the Tao Teh King has proved to be a most difficult and\\nyet fascinating\\ntask, and many attempts have been made to give the\\nmeaning of the text in various languages. Very often, however, alien\\ninfluences have crept in to distort the true meaning. We have chosen\\nhere a translation that seeks to divest the work of any Gonfucian or\\nother antagonistic influences and render into English the exact mean-\\nings as Taoist scholars believe they should be given.\\nThe work is a series of wise sayings and generalizations arranged with\\nno idea of order.\\nIt was written sometime during the first half of the\\nsixth century b.g.\\n2.

However, Confucius never thought of his\\nwork as that of a founder of a religion but rather as that of a social\\nand administrative reformer.\\nChina had been religious long before Confucius. In\\nfact, from\\nits\\nearliest days, about 2356 b.g., China has had an official religion. Dur-\\ning the latter part of the sixth century b.g., however, the government\\nwas falling into decay and^the moral life of the people was not good.\\nIt was at that time that the young Confucius became famous as a\\nteacher. This success was followed by success in political office and then\\nas an itinerant preacher. As a result of his works and\\nlife, the religion\\nof China, which had existed for centuries unnamed, became known as\\nConfucianism.\\nConfucius lived between 551 and 478 b.g. in the province of Shan-\\ntung, China, an area which has since been regarded as the Chinese\\nHoly Land. The youngest of eleven children, Confucius had to work\\nhard during his youth because of the early death of his father. He mar-\\nried at 19 and had one son and several daughters. Between 21 and 51\\nhe was a successful teacher and a generous helper of the poor so that\\nlocally he became a famous figure. This led to several official appoint-\\nments, the highest of which was Chief Justice of his state. After 55 he\\ndevoted himself largely to preaching and reform of the moral and re-\\nligious\\nlife of the people. In later yearn he compiled “The Classics”,\\nwriting little himself. He died at 72, feeling that his life had not been a\\nsuccess.\\nBut his work, and his great ability to win loyal disciples, resulted in\\nhis becoming the “founder” of Confucianism, although\\nthis was the\\nlast thing of which he dreamed.\\nGradually the\\nChinese people developed a system of worship, a\\ntheology, and a body of doctrines centered about the\\nbelief in\\nthe\\ndivinity of Confucius. Today popular Confucianism\\nis a religion in\\nSiX\\n92\\nCONFUCIANISM\\nevery sense of the term. Temples for worship are to be found in\\nall\\nparts of China and Confucius is venerated along with founders of other\\nreligions.\\nThe sacred scriptures of Confucianism are divided into two groups.\\nThe first group, “The Classics”, was compiled by Confucius out of the\\nsacred lore of the ancient Chinese religion. There are six books in this\\ngroup, as follows\\n1. The Shu King or Book of History^\\n2- Th&Shih Kingox Book of Foetry^\\n3.\\nI King or Book of Changes,\\n4. The Li Ki or Book of Rites,\\n5. The CKun ChHu or Spring and Autumn Annals,\\n6. The Hsiao King or Book of Filial Piety.\\nOf these, the first two are most important and most interesting to the\\naverage reader.\\nThe second group of Gonfucian scriptures\\nis “The Four Books”, as\\nfollows:\\n1. The Ta Hsio or Great Learning, a book of teachings concerning\\nvirtue,\\n2. The Chung Yung or Doctrine of the Mean,\\nTint Lun Yu or\\nAnalects,\\n4. The Meng-tze or Book of Mencius,\\nThe best known and most often read is the Lun Yu, commonly called\\nThe Analects of Confucius. This book contains a group of sayings sup-\\nposedly by Confucius.\\nAlthough these writings are not claimed to be inspired in any super-\\nnatural way,\\nthey\\nhave\\nactually\\nexerted\\ngreat\\ninfluence upon\\nthe\\n•Chinese character. In them we find much that reminds us of Chris-\\ntianity as well as of other great religions.\\nTHE SHU KING\\nShu\\nKing\\n{Book\\nof\\nHistory)\\nis\\nthe\\noldest\\nof\\nthe\\nChinese\\nelassical books known to man. It is concerned with the history of China\\nand contains historical documents relating to the period from 2357 to\\n627\\nB.G., and\\nbears\\nthe\\nsubtitle Book\\nof\\nHistory: Although some\\nlate scholars gave the impression that this book was written by Con-\\nfucius,\\nit\\nis most\\ndefinitely known now that the book existed before\\nhis time.

These “sayings” were not written\\ndown when spoken, but were passed from disciple to disciple for pos-\\nsibly 50\\nyears\\nafter\\nthe\\nMaster’s death. Then they were\\ngathered\\ntogether and written down for preservation.\\nThese sayings, in very much the same form as they appear in the\\nwritten work, are to be found in many places throughout the lands in-\\nhabited by followers\\nof Confucius so that scholars are led to believe\\nthat here is a fairly accurate expression of the thinking of the Master.\\nThere\\nis no order of arrangement, but the sayings are\\nscattered\\nthroughout the book without reason or plan. The essence of the entire\\nbook, however, may be summed up in two phrases : duty to oneself and\\ncharity to one’s neighbor.\\n1,2,2:\\n*‘The superior man bends his\\nattention to what is radical.

Most of his work was done\\nin Ch’ij the one of the three great Chinese kingdoms toward the east.\\nBut, because of his independence and tactlessness, he was not a great\\nsuccess and, in 309 b.g., received a rebuff which convinced him of the\\nfutility of his efforts.

The\\nfeeling of compassion\\nis\\nthe origin of benevolence; the feeling\\nof shame is the origin of righteousness;\\nthe feeling of consideration for others\\nis the origin of good manners ; the feel-\\ning of right and wrong is the origin of\\nwisdom.

These offended a great many fine and\\nsensitive spirits in India\\nwho eventually sought\\nafter reforms. Jainism was the\\nfirst organized\\neffort to effect such reform.\\nIt was followed about 30 years\\nlater by\\nBuddhism, another similar movement. Both movements eventually be-\\ncame separate religions, growing out of Hinduism but developing into\\nseparate bodies of belief and doctrine.\\nAlthough Jainism has not spread outside\\nof India and\\nis not ac-\\ncepted by a large following, there being about 1,250,000 Jains today,\\nit has had a tremendous influence over the development of India. Most\\nJains are merchants and,\\nas such, have acquired considerable wealth\\nwith which to control much of the commercial\\nlife of the southern\\nand western\\ndistricts of India. Further, their architecture has played\\na prominent role in the country. The Jain memorial mound at Muthura\\nis believed by many to be the oldest existing building in India. Further,\\namong the architectural treasures of India are the beautiful monolithic\\nJain temple\\nat Kaligamalai\\nin southern\\nIndia and\\nthe temples\\nat\\nAhmedabad, Ellora, Ajmere^ and Mount Abu in western India.\\nIt\\nis\\nto these places\\nthat travelers from all parts of the world go when\\nthey visit India.\\nThe founder of Jainism was Mahavira, who lived between 599 and\\n527 B.G. This was a time of religious ferment throughout the East. It\\nwas the period when Confucius and Lao-tze were working in China,\\nZoroaster was preaching in Persia, the great prophets of the Babylonian\\nexile, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah, were teaching and preaching to the\\nJews, and the early Greek philosophers were seeking for a reasoned ex-\\nplanation of the universe and man’s relation to it.\\nAs a youth Mahavira lived the life of a pampered prince who had\\n119\\n\\'\\n120\\nJAINISM\\nevery opportunity for wealth and position. He married the daughter\\nof another princely family, and had one daughter. Then, upon the\\ndeath of his parents, Mahavira resolved to renounce the world and\\nbecome an ascetic. He is said to have given away all he possessed, pulled\\nout all his hair in five handfuls, and vowed absolute holiness. For a few\\nmonths he wore clothes, but soon gave them up and lived as a naked\\nascetic, wandering about receiving injuries from men and beasts and\\nimposing all kinds of self-torture upon himself. This he did in an effort\\nto gain complete mastery over himself and his body.\\nWhen he believed that he had obtained\\nthis mastery, he returned\\nto social life and became a leader and teacher. He won many converts\\nand gained the favor of four kings. This work was continued the re-\\nmainder of his life.\\nAlthough Mahavira taught that one should worship no man or ob-\\nject, but should live\\n\\'‘a\\nlife quiet and unperturbed, self-denying and\\nharmless and prayerless,’’ his followers came very soon to worship hini\\nas divine. Later many stories of miracles grew up about his memory.\\nHe was believed to have been omniscient, pre-existent, and a divine\\nsaviour of men. Today he\\nis idolized by\\nhis followers who worship\\nimages of him.\\nThe sacred\\nscriptures of Jainism are usually called Agamas\\n(pre-\\ncepts)\\nor Siddhantas\\n(treatises). The first Agama\\nis called Ayatanya\\nSutra, Originally this Agama consisted of twelve Angas\\n(bodies) , but\\nonly eleven are extant at present, the twelfth having been\\nlost. The\\nsecond Agama\\nis called Sutrakritanga, Another Agama of importance\\nis the Uttaradhyayana Sutra, There are many other Agamas which\\nhave not been translated into English. Indeed, Jains are broken into\\nsects due to disagreement as to the number of Agamas which are to be\\naccepted as authoritative. One sect, the Sthanakvasi, holds that only 33\\nare sacred. The Svetambara sect recognizes 45, while other sects accept\\nas many as 84. Nevertheless, regardless of the number of Agamas which\\na particular sect accepts, very few Jains are acquainted with their scrip-\\ntures due to the fact that most Jains know nothing of the\\nPrakrit\\nvernacular of the documents or of Sanskrit, the language of the com-\\nmentaries.\\nToday the Jains are a small religious group in India, self-centered\\nand\\nexclusive. The two main\\nsects came into being over the ques-\\ntion of wearing clothes. Those living in the north where the climate\\nis\\ncool, the Svetambara, wear clothes, and those further south,\\nthe\\nDigambara or ‘^sky-clad,” wear no clothes except where Mohammedan\\ninvaders have forced them to wear a loin cloth. These Jains carry their\\ndispute to their idols. Those of the north clothe their idols in white gar-\\nJAINISM\\n121\\nments while those of the south leave their idols naked. They also differ\\nin their attitude toward women. In the north nuns are accepted as\\nrtiembers of the sect; in the south women are held to be excluded from\\nsalvation until they are reborn as men.\\nTHE AYARANYA SUTRA\\nThe Ayaranya Sutra^ sometimes called the Samayika, is the first book\\nof the Jain canon. It deals with problems of condnct\\nThis Agama consists of two sections. Of these, the first is a basic docu-\\nment, whereas the second\\nis a grouping of four appendices. The basic\\nsection\\ndescribes\\nthe\\nprogress\\nof a\\nfaithful individual towards\\nthe\\nhighest perfection. Perhaps the\\nlast lesson, a popular ballad on the\\nglorious suffering of the prophet, was added later.\\nA large part of both sections is written in the most bewildering prose.\\nMany of the sentences are mere fragments and others are difficult for\\none to understand. Some scholars believe that this work is made up of\\nquotations taken at random from other works which were well-known\\nat the time but are unknown today.\\nThe first section contains eight lectures, a ninth having been lost. The\\nsecond section consists of four parts, the\\nfirst and second stating rules\\nof conduct. The third and fourth parts, according to Jain tradition,\\nwere revealed to the oldest sister of Sthulabhadra by Simandhara, a\\nJain, living in Purvavideha, a mythical continent. The third part gives\\nsome material about the\\nlife of Mahavira, the founder of Jainism.\\n1,1,6,6: He who injures these\\n(ani-\\nmals)\\ndoes\\nnot\\ncomprehend\\nand\\nrenounce the sinful acts; he who does\\nnot\\ninjure\\nthese,\\ncomprehends\\nand\\nrenounces\\nthe\\nsinful\\nacts.\\nKnowing\\nthem, a wise man should not act sin-\\nfully toward animals, nor cause others\\nto act\\nso, nor allow others\\nto act\\nso.\\nHe who\\nknows\\nthese\\ncauses\\nof\\nsin\\nrelating to animals, is called a reward-\\nknowing sage. Thus I say.\\n1,2,2,1: A wise man should remove\\nany aversion\\n(to control) ; he will be\\nliberated\\nin\\nthe proper\\ntime.\\nSome,\\nfollowing wrong instruction, turn away\\n(from\\ncontrol).\\nThey\\nare\\ndull,\\nwrapped in delusion. While they imi-\\ntate the\\nlife of monks,\\n(saying), **We\\nshall be\\nfree from attachment,’*\\nthey\\nenjoy\\nthe\\npleasures\\nthat\\noffer them-\\nselves. Through wrong instruction the\\n(would-be)\\nsages\\ntrouble\\nthemselves\\n(for pleasures)\\n; thus they sink deeper\\nand deeper in\\ndelusion,\\n(and cannot\\nget)\\nto this, nor to the opposite shore.\\nThose who are freed (from attachment\\nto the world and its pleasures), reach\\nthe opposite shore. Subduing desire by\\ndesirelessness,\\nhe\\ndoes\\nnot\\nenjoy\\nthe\\npleasures that offer themselves. Desire-\\nless, giving up the world, and ceasing\\nto act, he knows, and sees, and has no\\nwishes because of his discernment; he\\nis called houseless.\\n1,2,2,3:\\nThus\\nviolence\\nis done by\\nthese various acts, deliberately, out of\\nfear, because they think\\n**it\\nis for the\\nexpiation\\nof\\nsins,” or for some other\\nhope. Knowing this, a wise man should\\nneither\\nhimself\\ncommit\\nviolence\\nby\\nsuch acts, nor order others to commit\\nviolence by such\\nacts, nor consent to\\nthe violence done by somebody else.\\nThis road\\n(to happiness)\\nhas been\\n122\\nTHE AYARANYA SUTRA\\n123\\ndeclared by\\nthe\\nnoble\\nones,\\nthat\\na\\nclever man should not be defiled\\n(by\\nsin).

All beings are fond of life, like\\npleasure, hate pain, shun destruction,\\nlike life, long to live. To all life is dear.\\n1,2,6,1: He who\\nperfectly\\nunder-\\nstands (what has been said in the pre-\\nceding lesson) and follows the\\n(faith)\\nto be coveted, should therefore do no\\nsinful act, nor cause others\\nto do one.\\nPerchance he meditates\\na\\nsin\\n(by an\\nact against only)\\none\\n(of the\\nsix\\nag-\\ngregates of lives )\\n;\\nbut he will be guilty\\n(of sin against)\\nevery one\\nof\\nthe^ six.\\nDesiring\\nhappiness\\nand\\nbewailing\\nmuch,\\nhe comes\\nignorantly\\nto\\ngrief\\nthrough his own misfortune.\\n1,2,6,5:\\nThus understanding\\n(and\\nrenouncing)\\nacts, a man .who recog-\\nnizes\\nthe\\ntruth,\\ndelights\\nin\\nnothing\\nelse; and he who delights only in the\\ntruth, recognizes nothing else.

Founded by Gautama\\n(b.g, 563-483)\\n,\\nson of a rich Hindu rajah of the Sakya clan,\\nit was merely a system of\\nmorality and philosophy based on the belief that life was too full of\\nsuffering to be worth living. For a long time\\nits principles and moral\\ncode appealed to people of many and varied religious beliefs. Then,\\ngradually, Gautama was deified as the Buddha, or the “Enlightened,”\\nmiracle stories grew up about his life, and what was originally an im-\\nportant system of morals and philosophic thought became a religion.\\nToday Buddhism\\nis regarded by scholars\\nas the\\nfirst\\nof the great\\ninternational religions, being followed later by Ghristianity and Mo-\\nhammedanism. While hundreds of millions are tremendously influenced\\nby the moral and philosophic teachings of Gautama, they cannot be\\ntruly classed as Buddhists. It is nearer the truth to say that those who\\nworship Gautama, pray to him, and accept the doctrine of his divinity\\nnumber near to 150,000,000.\\nAlthough beginning in India, Buddhism has\\npractically ceased\\nto\\nexist in that vast\\ncountry. Hindu Buddhists number today\\nslightly\\nover 2,500. It has spread, however, among the Mongolians. Neverthe-\\nless, as, a religion it is not making great gains today.\\nBom amid wealth and destined to rulership, Gautama was so im-\\npressed by the poverty and\\nsuffering of mankind that he renounced\\nhis birth, his family, and his fortune, and turned to the life of a monk.\\nAfter trying to find peaGe and a solution to the problems of universal\\nsuffering and misery through Hindiuism and later Jainism, he experi-\\nenced a “Great Enlightenment’’ at the age of 35. This consisted of a\\nfirm conviction that the only escape from\\nsuffering lay\\nin complete\\nrenunciation of all desires. Immediately he began preaching this new\\ndoctrine and gathering disciples. This he continued until his death at\\nthe age of 80.\\nBuddhist scriptures consist of the “Three Baskets”\\nof Wisdom and\\n133\\n134\\nBUDDHISM\\nthe Dhammapada, The first “Basket,” the Vinaya Pitaka, oi Discipline\\nBasket, contains minute rules for those who are to be initiated into the\\norder\\nof\\nhigh-class\\nBuddhists. The\\nsecond\\nis\\nthe\\nSutta\\nPitaka,\\nor\\nTeaching Basket.\\nThis\\ncontains\\nthe\\nsayings and\\nteachings\\nof\\nthe\\nBuddha. The third is the Abhidhamma Pitaka, or Metaphysical Basket.\\nHere are to be found detailed explanations of Buddhist doctrines and\\nof Buddhist psychology. The Dhammapada\\nis a collection of the say-\\nings of the Buddha. There are also many Buddhist writings which have\\nnot been accepted as canonical by the Buddhists.\\nNot all the sacred writings of Buddhism have been translated into\\nEnglish. Indeed, much of the Three Baskets has never even been pub-\\nlished in the original Pali, the dialect of the common people of north-\\ncentral India. Although much work has been done by Western scholars\\non this material, only a small part is available for study.\\nTHE VINAYA PITAKA\\nMahavagga\\n‘‘Now what think you, Sona,—when\\nthe\\nstrings\\nof your lute were neither\\nThs MdhcLvaggcL\\nts a section\\nof the\\ntoo much stretched nor too loose, but\\nVinaya Pitaka\\n{Discipline Basket)\\nof\\nfixed in even proportion, had your lute\\nBuddhism.\\nHere\\nare\\nto\\nhe\\nfound\\nsound then, was\\nit then in a\\nfit state\\nnumerous\\ndirections\\nand\\nteachings\\nto be played upon?”\\nWfitten for the instruction\\nof initiates\\n“Yes\\nLord!”\\ninto\\nthe\\nhigher\\nclass\\nof\\nBuddhism.\\n\"And just\\nso, Sona, does too eager\\nRules\\nare\\nlaid\\ndown\\nand\\ndetailed\\n2l\\ndetermination\\nconduce\\nto\\nself-\\n^directions\\nfor\\npreparation and\\nliving\\nrighteousness, and\\ntoo weak a deter-\\nare\\nstated.\\nThe\\ncandidate\\nmust\\nhe\\nmination to sloth.”\\nfit and willing to live a clean, virtuous\\nlife.

Indeed, Christianity grew out of Judaism and includes the\\nsacred writings of Judaism among its own sacred literature.\\nThe sacred scriptures of Judaism consist of 39 “books” or writings\\nwhich are generally known\\nas the Old Testament. These books are\\nusually divided by the Jews into three groups as follows\\n:\\nI,\\nTorah\\nor Law:\\nGenesis,\\nExodus,\\nLeviticus,\\nNumbers,\\nand\\nDeuteronomy,\\nII.\\nNebiim or The Prophets\\n: Joshua, Judges, I Samuel, II Samuel,\\nI Kings, 11 Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, Amos,\\nObadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Hag-\\ngai, Zachariah, Malachi.\\nIII.\\nKethubim or Sacred Writings: Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of\\nSolomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra,\\nNehemiah, I Chronicles, II Chronicles.\\nAll of these books were originally composed in Hebrew, except ap-\\nproximately half of Daniel, some parts of Ezra, and a verse of Jeremiah\\nThese latter were written in Aramaic.\\nThere are other documents read by the Hebrews and held to have\\nspecial religious value even though they are not included in the canon\\nof scriptures. Chief among these is the Talmud, which is divided into\\nthe Mishna, or text, and the Gemara, or commentary.\\nSeveral writings have been grouped together and are known as the\\nApocrypha, These books formed\\npart of the\\nsacred\\nwritings\\nof\\nthe\\nAlexandrian Jews and are\\nto be found\\nas part of the Hebrew scrip-\\ntures\\nin\\nearly\\nmanuscripts. However, most\\nauthorities\\nreject\\nthem-\\n153\\n154\\nJUDAISM\\nAlthough the Council of Trent, defining the doctrines of Catholicism,\\ndeclared them\\nto be\\ncanonical and\\nordered them\\nincluded\\nin\\nthe\\nBible, the books are usually omitted from the Protestant Bible.\\nThe sacred scriptures of Judaism represent a literary activity spread-\\ning over more than 1,000 years. The earlier books were produced in a\\nsemi-savage, nomadic culture and reflect the crude, war-infested think-\\ning of these early people, who were polytheistic, believed in polygamy,\\nand practiced many religious rites that seem strange to us today. Chief\\namong\\nthese was human\\nsacrifice. However,\\nduring\\nthe\\nperiod\\nof\\ndevelopment which\\nis\\nreflected\\nin\\nthese\\nwritings,\\nthe Hebrews\\nrose\\nfrom this semi-savage state to a highly moral and ethical civilization.\\nTheir leaders preached a code of human relationships that reach be-\\nyond much that we have been able to attain even in our own day. By\\nso doing, they repudiated the teachings and practices of their primi-\\ntive\\nancestors. There\\nis a great difference between the god\\nof\\nthe\\nearly Hebrews who ordered his followers to destroy their enemies even\\nto dashing the heads of babies against rocks and the God of Isaiah and\\nHosea who taught men to love their enemies.\\nThe literature of the Hebrews reflects this development from primi-\\ntive life to civilization, from crude beliefs of nomadic tribesmen to the\\nhigh\\nethical idealism\\nof\\nthe\\nprophets, from\\nthe nature worship\\nof\\nAbraham to the. spiritual insight of Isaiah. Thus the Old Testament\\nis a history of Hebrew literature and\\nof Hebrew moral and\\nethical\\ndevelopment.\\nAs the Hebrews roamed about and came into contact with other\\npeoples and other religious beliefs and practices, they borrowed much,\\nadding what they borrowed to their religion and dropping some\\nof\\ntheir own\\nrites and beliefs.\\nIt\\nis possible to find much of Egyptian,\\nBabylonian, and other religious beliefs mixed into Judaism.\\nOne of the great ideas running through much of Hebrew sacred\\nliterature is belief in a coming Messiah who would restore a traditional\\nand often imaginary glory of the Jewish race. God is believed to be, in\\na peculiar way, the God of the Jews and to have a special place for\\nthem in the scheme of things. Thus the Jew looked for a Messiah who\\nwould carry out God’s plan for them.\\nJesus was acclaimed by many as the promised Messiah\\nat a time\\nwhen the Jews were greatly interested in the coming\\nof a Messiah.\\nThe Maccabees and others had attempted\\nto\\nstir up\\nrevolt\\nagainst\\nthe Roman overlords so that the Jews might attain a position of re-\\nnewed pride and honor. In Jesus a great many saw the fulfilment of\\nthis hope. But Jesus failed the militant Jews and they turned from him.\\nHe did not attempt an armed revolt against the Romans, but rather\\nJUDAISM\\n^\\npreached peace and subjection. He taught that all men were brothers\\nand equal in the sight of God.\\nThus the Jews continue to look for this “Coming One\\nwho will\\nrestore their ancient glory.\\nTHE OLD TESTAMENT\\nThe “books” or writings contained in the Old Testament, 39 of them,\\nare the canonical works sacred to the Jews. This\\nis, of course, a small\\nselection of the great mass of literature which has come down to us\\nfrom the early centuries of Hebrew life. But this group of books con-\\ntains history and legend, poetry, drama, wise sayings, polemic writing^\\nsermons and tracts written for special purposes.\\nThe first five books of the Old Testament, attributed to Moses, are\\na composite of many documents which have unknown origins. Gradu-\\nally these documents, along with stories and legends of the early days\\nof the race, were brought together by some unknown author or authors\\nand became the books that we know.\\nThe prophetic books of the Old Testament deal with the preaching\\nof a number of individuals who were attempting to awaken the people\\nto their mistakes and shortcomings. The Hebrews lived among enemies,\\nboth without and within the nation. Unless the Hebrews continued to\\nbe vigilant, these enemies would destroy thern. The prophets associated\\nthis situation with religion and held such mistakes and shortcomings\\nto be sins. Further, they preached that God was on their side\\nif they\\nwould only use him. The prophets were wise men who saw the social\\nand political dangers threatening the nation and attempted to awaken\\nthe people, calling them to a religious crusade that would save them.\\nThe Sacred Writings are a large group of books written for many\\npurposes, some religious and others not. Ruth, for example,\\nis a tract\\nwritten to show that the grandmother of the great King David was\\nnot a Jewess. The Song of Solomon is a collection of wedding songs.\\nPsalms are songs which the Jews sang in their synagogues or at other\\nreligious gatherings. Job\\nis a drama dealing with the problem of the\\ngood man who suffers. The religious value of these books varies from\\nbook to book. To meet this problem and make ail the books of equal\\nreligious value, some ancient scholars used\" the\\nallegorical approach.\\nThey argued that the writings did not mean what they said, but were\\nto be interpreted as allegories. However, this aJ)proach is not approved\\nby most of the modern scholars.\\nGenesis\\nGreek\\ntranslation\\nof\\nthe\\nBible.\\nThe\\nHebrew name\\nfor\\nthis book\\nis Beres-\\nGenesis,\\nmeaning\\ngeneration\\nor\\nhith,\\nmeaning\\n‘‘in\\nthe\\nbeginning.\\'\"\\norigin^\\nis\\nthe\\ntitle\\nof\\nthis book\\nas\\nit\\nThe\\nbook was\\nfirst\\nput\\ninto\\nwritten\\nappears\\nin\\nthe\\nSeptuagint, an\\nearly\\nform from\\nearly documents\\nin\\nabout\\n156\\nTHE OLD TESTAMENT\\n157\\nthe eighth century B.C.\\nIt deals with\\nseed was\\nin itself, after\\nhis kind: and\\nthe\\norigin\\nand\\nearly\\nhistory\\nand\\nGod saw\\nthat\\nit was good.\\nlegends\\nof\\nthe\\nIsraelites.\\n13.

There\\nis none holy as the Lord:\\nfor there\\nis none beside thee:\\nneither\\nis there any rock like our God.\\n3- Talk\\nno\\nmore\\nso\\nexceeding\\nproudly ; let not arrogancy come out of\\nyour mouth : for the Lord\\nis a God o£\\nknowledge,\\nand\\nby him\\nactions\\nare\\nweighed.\\n4. The bows of the mighty men are\\nbroken,\\nand\\nthey\\nthat\\nstumbled\\nare\\ngirded with strength,\\n5. They that were\\nfull have\\nhiredf\\nout\\nthemselves\\nfor\\nbread; and\\nthey\\nthat were hungry ceased:\\nso that the\\nbarren hath born seven; and she that\\nhath many children is waxed feeble,\\n6. The Lord\\nkilleth, and\\nmaketh\\nalive; he bringeth down to the grave,\\nand bringeth up.\\n7. The\\nLord\\nmaketh\\npoor,\\nand\\nmaketh\\nrich:\\nhe\\nbringeth\\nlow,\\nand\\nlifteth up.\\n8. He\\nraiseth up\\nthe poor\\nout of\\nthe\\ndust, and\\nlifteth up\\nthe\\nbeggar\\nfrom the dunghill, to set them among\\nprinces,\\nand\\nto make\\nthem\\ninherit\\n170\\nJUDAISM\\nthe throne of glory:\\nfor the pillars of\\nthe earth are the Lord’s, and he hath\\nset the world upon them.\\n9. He will keep the feet of his saints,\\nand the wicked shall be silent in dark-\\nness;\\nfor\\nby\\nstrength\\nshall\\nno man\\nprevail.\\n10. The\\nadversaries\\nof\\nthe\\nLord\\nshall\\nbe\\nbroken\\nto\\npieces;\\nout\\nof\\nheaven\\nshall he thunder upon them:\\nthe Lord shall judge the ends of the\\nearth; and he shall give strength unto\\nhis\\nking,\\nand\\nexalt\\nthe horn\\nof\\nhis\\nanointed.\\nII Samuel\\nChapter 22\\n1. And David spake unto the Lord\\nthe words of this song in the day that\\nthe Lord had delivered him out of the\\nhand of all his enemies, and out of the\\nhand of Saul:\\n2. And\\nhe\\nsaid. The Lord\\nis my\\nrock, and my\\nfortress, and my\\ndeliv-\\nerer;\\n3. The God of my rock; in him will\\nI trust: he\\nis my shield, and the horn\\nof my\\nsalvation, my high tower, and\\nmy refuge, my saviour ; thou savest me\\nfrom violence.\\n4.\\nI will\\ncall on the Lord, who\\nis\\nworthy\\nto be\\npraised:\\nso\\nshall\\nI be\\nsaved from mine enemies.\\n5. When\\nthe waves\\nof death com-\\npassed me, the floods of ungodly men\\nmade me afraid\\n;\\n6. The\\nsorrows\\nof\\nhell compassed\\nme\\nabout;\\nthe\\nsnares\\nof\\ndeath\\npre-\\nvented me\\n;\\n7. In my distress\\nI called upon the\\nLord, and cried\\nto my God: and he\\ndid hear my voice out of his temple,\\nand my cry did enter into his ears.\\n8. Then the earth shook and trem-\\nbled ; the foundations of heaven moved\\nand shook, because he was wroth.\\n9. There went up a smoke out of his\\nnostrils,\\nand\\nfire\\nout\\nof\\nhis mouth\\ndevoured :\\ncoals were kindled by it.\\n\\\\0. He bowed the heavens also, and\\ncame down; and darkness was under\\nhis\\nfeet.\\n11. And he rode upon a cherub, and\\ndid\\nfly :\\nand\\nhe was\\nseen upon\\nthe\\nwings of the wind,\\n12. And he made darkness pavilions\\nround\\nabout\\nhim,\\ndark\\nwaters,\\nand\\nthick clouds of the skies.\\n13. Through\\nthe\\nbrightness\\nbefore\\nhim were coals of fire kindled.\\n14. The\\nLord\\nthundered\\nfrom\\nheaven, and the most High uttered his\\nvoice.\\n15. And\\nhe\\nsent\\nout\\narrows,\\nand\\nscattered them; lightning, and discom-\\nfited them.\\n16. And the channels of the sea ap-\\npeared,\\nthe foundations of the world\\nwere\\ndiscovered,\\nat\\nthe\\nrebuking\\nof\\nthe Lord, at the blast of the breath of\\nhis nostrils.\\n17. He\\nsent from\\nabove,\\nhe\\ntook\\nme; he drew me out of many waters;\\n18. He delivered me from my strong\\nenemy, and from them that hated me:\\nfor they were too strong for me.\\n19. They prevented me in the day\\nof my calamity : but the Lord was my\\nstay.\\n20. He brought me forth also into a\\nlarge place: he delivered me, because\\nhe delighted in me.\\n21. The Lord rewarded me accord-\\ning to my righteousness:\\naccording to\\nthe\\ncleanness\\nof my hands\\nhath\\nhe\\nrecompensed me.\\n22. For I have kept the ways of the\\nLord, and have not wickedly departed\\nfrom my God.\\n23. For\\nall his judgments were be-\\nfore me: and as for his statutes, I did\\nnot depart from them.\\n24.\\nI was also upright before him,\\nand have kept myself from mine\\nin-\\niquity.\\n25. Therefore the Lord hath recom-\\npensed me according to my righteous-\\nness; according to my cleanness in his\\neye sight.\\n26.

And\\nthe\\nafflicted\\npeople\\nthou\\nwilt save: but thine eyes are upon the\\nhaughty, that thou mayest bring them\\ndown.\\n29. For thou art my lamp, O Lord:\\nand\\nthe Lord\\nwill\\nlighten my dark-\\nness.\\n30. For by thee I have run through\\na\\ntroop:\\nby my God\\nhave\\nI\\nleaped\\nover a wall.\\n31. As for God,\\nhis way\\nis perfect;\\nthe word of the Lord\\nis tried: he\\nis a\\nbuckler to all them that trust in him.\\n32. For who is God, save the Lord?\\nand who is a rock, save our God?\\n33. God\\nis my strength and power:\\nand he maketh my way perfect.\\n34. He maketh my feet\\nlike hinds*\\nfeet:\\nand\\nsetteth me upon my high\\nplaces.\\n35. He teacheth my hands to war;\\nso\\nthat a bow\\nof\\nsteel\\nis broken by\\nmine arms.\\n36. Thou\\nhast\\nalso\\ngiven me\\nthe\\nshield of thy salvation: and thy gen-\\ntleness hath made me great.\\n37. Thou\\nhast\\nenlarged my\\nsteps\\nunder me; so that my feet did not slip.\\n38.\\nI\\nhave pursued mine\\nenemies,\\nand\\ndestroyed them ; and\\nturned not\\nagain until I had consumed them.\\n39. And I have consumed them, and\\nwounded\\nthem,\\nthat\\nthey\\ncould\\nnot\\narise:\\nyea,\\nthey are fallen under my\\nfeet.\\n40. For thou\\nhast girded me with\\nstrength\\nto battle: them that rose up\\nagainst me\\nhast thou subdued under\\nme.\\n41. Thou\\nhast\\nalso\\ngiven me\\nthe\\nnecks of mine\\nenemies, that\\nI might\\ndestroy them that hate me.\\n42. They looked, but there was none\\nto save; even unto the Lord, but he\\nanswered them not.\\n43. Then did\\nI beat them as small\\nas the dust of the earth,\\nI did stamp\\nthem as\\nthe mire\\nof\\nthe\\nstreet, and\\ndid spread them abroad.\\n44. Thou\\nalso\\nhast\\ndelivered me\\nfrom the strivings of my people, thou\\nhast\\nkept\\nme\\nto\\nbe\\nhead\\nof\\nthe\\nheathen : a people which\\nI knew not\\nshall serve me.\\n45. Strangers\\nshall\\nsubmit\\nthem-\\nselves unto me:\\nas soon as they Hear,\\nthey shall be obedient unto me.\\n46. Strangers shall fade away, and\\nthey shall be afraid out of their close\\nplaces.\\n47. The Lord liveth; and blessed be\\nmy rock; and exalted be the God of\\nthe rock of my salvation.\\n48. It\\nis God\\nthat\\navengeth\\nme,\\nand\\nthat\\nbringeth down\\nthe\\npeople\\nunder me,\\n49. And that bringeth me forth from\\nmine enemies:\\nthou\\nalso\\nhast\\nlifted\\nme up on high above them that rose\\nup\\nagainst me:\\nthou\\nhast\\ndelivered\\nme from the violent man.\\n50. Therefore\\nI\\nwill\\ngive\\nthanks\\nunto\\nthee, O\\nLord,\\namong\\nthe\\nheathen, and\\nI\\nwill sing\\npraises unto\\nthy name,\\n51.

These\\nare the Old Testament Apocrypha and the New Testament Apocrypha.\\nThe Old Testament Apocrypha\\nis a group of books that appear in\\nearly Greek and Latin versions of the Bible, usually at the end of the\\nOld Testament,\\nbut which\\nare excluded from\\nthe Hebrew canon.\\nThe Roman Catholic Church includes these books in the canon. The\\nChurch of England excludes them from the canon but accepts them\\nas valuable “for example of life and instruction of manners” although\\nnot to “establish doctrine”. These books consist of independent works\\nand additions to the canonical works\\nin the form\\nof extra\\nchapters.\\nThe Old Testament Apocrypha includes the following writings: i\\nEsdraSy 11 Esdras, The Book of Tobit, The Book of Judith^ Additions\\nto the Book of Esther3 The Wisdom of Solomon^ The Wisdom of Jesus\\nthe Son of Sirach, The Book of Baruch with the Epistle of Jeremiah^\\nThe Song of the Three Holy Children^ The History of Susanna^ The\\nHistory\\nof\\nthe Destruction\\nof Bel and\\nthe Dragon, The Prayer\\nof\\nManasses, and the Four Books of the Maccabees.\\nEight other apocryphal writings of the Old Testament which are\\nsometimes called Pseudepigrapha, are: The Book\\nof Jubilees or The\\nLittle Genesis, The Book\\nof Enoch, The Assumption\\nof Moses, The\\nAscension of Isaiah, The Apocalypse of Baruch, The Sibylline Oracles,\\nThe Psalter of Solomon, and The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,\\nNone of these eight have been given canonical recognition.\\nThe apocryphal books are part of the sacred literature of the Alex-\\nandrian Jews and are products\\nof the years subsequent\\nto the Cap-\\ntivity or during the last three centuries before the Christian era.\\nwill be set to\\nsin, or to transgress\\nhis\\ncommandments:\\ndo\\nuprightly\\nall thy\\nlife long, and follow not the ways of\\nunrighteousness.\\n6.

We fools accounted his life mad-\\nness, and\\nhis end to be without hon-\\nour:\\n5. How\\nis he numbered among the\\nchildren of God, and his lot is among\\nthe saints!\\n6. Therefore\\nhave we\\nerred from\\nthe way\\nof\\ntruth,\\nand\\nthe\\nlight\\nof\\nrighteousness hath not shined unto us,\\nand the sun of righteousness rose not\\nupon\\nus.\\n7. We wearied ourselves in the way\\nof\\nwickedness and\\ndestruction:\\nyea,\\nwe have gone through\\ndeserts, where\\nthere lay no way\\n:\\nbut as for the way\\nof the Lord, we have not known it.\\n8. What hath pride profited us? or\\n222\\nJUDAISM\\nwhat good hath riches with our vaunt-\\ning brought us?\\n9.\\nAll those things are passed away\\nlike\\na\\nshadow,\\nand\\nas\\na\\npost\\nthat\\nhasted by;\\n10. And as a ship that passeth over\\nthe waves of the water, which when it\\nis gone\\nby,\\nthe\\ntrace\\nthereof cannot\\nbe found, neither the pathway of the\\nkeel in the waves;\\n11. Or as when a bird hath flown\\nthrough the\\nair, there\\nis no token of\\nher way to be found, but the light air\\nbeing beaten with\\nthe\\nstroke\\nof her\\nwings,\\nand\\nparted\\nwith\\nthe\\nviolent\\nnoise and motion\\nof them,\\nis passed\\nthrough,\\nand\\ntherein\\nafterwards\\nno\\nsign where she went\\nis\\nto be found;\\n12.

Even so we in like manner, as\\nsoon as we were born, began to draw\\nto our end, and had no sign of virtue\\nto shew; but were consumed\\nin our\\nown wickedness.\\n14. For the hope of the ungodly\\nis\\nlike dust that is blown away with the\\nwind; like a thin froth that\\nis driven\\naway\\nwith\\nthe\\nstorm;\\nlike\\nas\\nthe\\nsmoke\\nwhich\\nis\\ndispersed\\nhere\\nand\\nthere\\nwith\\na\\ntempest,\\nand\\npasseth\\naway as the remembrance\\nof a guest\\nthat tarrieth but a day.\\n15. But the righteous live for ever-\\nmore;\\ntheir reward\\nalso\\nis with\\nthe\\nLord, and the care of them is with the\\nmost High.\\nChapter 8\\n1. Wisdom reacheth from one end\\n.0 another mightily: and sweetly doth\\nshe order all things.\\n2.\\nI loved her, and sought her out\\nfrom my youth,\\nI desired to make her\\nmy spouse, and\\nI was a lover of her\\nbeauty.\\n3. In\\nthat\\nshe\\nis\\nconversant\\nwith\\nGod, she magnifieth her nobility: yea,\\nthe Lord\\nof\\nall\\nthings\\nhimself loved\\nher.\\n4. For she\\nis privy to the mysteries\\nof the knowledge of God, and a lover\\nof his works.\\n5.\\nIf\\nriches\\nbe\\na\\npossession\\nto\\nbe\\ndesired in this life ; what is richer than\\nwisdom, that worketh\\nall things?\\n6. And\\nif prudence work ; who\\nof\\nall that are\\nis a more cunning work-\\nman than she?\\n7. And\\nif a man love righteousness,\\nher labours are virtues:\\nfor she teach-\\neth temperance and prudence, justice\\nand fortitude: which are such things,\\nas men can have nothing more profit-\\nable in their life.\\n8.\\nIf a man desire much experience,\\nshe knoweth\\nthings of old, and\\ncon-\\njectureth aright what\\nis to come:\\nshe\\nknoweth the subtilties of speeches, and\\ncan expound dark sentences: she fore-\\nseeth\\nsigns\\nand\\nwonders,\\nand\\nthe\\nevents of seasons and times.\\n9. Therefore I purposed to take her\\nto me\\nto\\nlive with me, knowing that\\nshe would\\nbe\\na\\ncounsellor\\nof\\ngood\\nthings,\\nand\\na\\ncomfort\\nin\\ncares and\\ngrief.\\n10. For her sake I\\nshall have\\nesti-\\nmation among the multitude, and hon-\\nour\\nwith\\nthe\\nelders,\\nthough\\nI\\nbe\\nyoung.\\n11.\\nI\\nshall\\nbe\\nfound\\nof\\na\\nquick\\nconceit in judgment, and shall be ad-\\nmired in the sight of great men.\\n12.

Now when\\nI\\nconsidered\\nthese\\nthings in myself, and pondered them\\nin my\\nheart, how\\nthat\\nto\\nbe\\nallied\\nunto wisdom\\nis immortality ;\\n18. And great pleasure\\nit is to have\\nher\\nfriendship; and\\nin\\nthe works\\nof\\nher hands\\nare\\ninfinite riches ; and\\nin\\nthe\\nexercise\\nof conference\\nwith\\nher,\\nprudence; and in talking with her, a\\ngood\\nreport;\\nI\\nwent\\nabout\\nseeking\\nhow to take her to me.\\n19. For\\nI was a\\nwitty\\nchild, and\\nhad a good spirit.\\n20. Yea rather, being good, I came\\ninto a body undefiled.\\n21. Nevertheless, when\\nI perceived\\nthat I could not otherwise obtain her,\\nexcept God gave her me ; and that was\\na point of wisdom also to know whose\\ngift she was ;\\nI prayed unto the Lord,\\nand besought him, and with my whole\\nheart I said.\\nChapter 9\\n1.

For thou art righteous in all the\\nthings that thou hast done to us: yea,\\ntrue are\\nall thy works, thy ways are\\nright, and all thy judgments truth.\\n5. In\\nall the things that thou hast\\nbrought upon us, and upon the holy\\ncity\\nof\\nour\\nfathers, even\\nJerusalem,\\nthou hast executed true judgment: for\\naccording to truth and judgment didst\\nthou\\nbring\\nall\\nthese\\nthings upon us\\nbecause of our\\nsins.\\n6. For we\\nhave\\nsinned and com-\\nmitted\\niniquity,\\ndeparting from\\nthee.\\n7. In all things have we trespassed,\\nand not obeyed\\nthy commandments,\\nnor kept them,\\nneither done as thou\\nhast commanded us, that\\nit might go\\nwell with us.\\n8. Wherefore\\nall\\nthat\\nthou\\nhast\\nbrought upon us, and every thing that\\nthou hast done to us, thou hast done\\nin true judgment.\\n9. And thou\\ndidst\\ndeliver\\nus\\ninto\\nthe\\nhands\\nof\\nlawless\\nenemies,\\nmost\\nhateful\\nforsakers\\nof God, and\\nto an\\nunjust king, and the most wicked in\\nall the world.\\n10. And now we cannot open our\\nmouths, we are become a shame and\\nreproach to thy servants, and to them\\nthat worship thee.\\n11. Yet\\ndeliver us not up wholly,\\nfor thy name^s sake, neither disannul\\nthou thy covenant:\\n12. And\\ncause\\nnot\\nthy\\nmercy\\nto\\ndepart from us, for thy beloved Abra-\\nham’s\\nsake,\\nfor\\nthy\\nservant\\nIsaac’s\\nsake, and for thy holy Israel’s sake;\\n13. To whom thou hast spoken and\\npromised, that thou wouldest multiply\\ntheir seed as the\\nstars of heaven, and\\nas the sand\\nthat\\nlieth upon the\\nsea-\\nshore.\\n14. For we, O Lord, are become less\\nthan any nation, and be kept under\\nthis day\\nin\\nall the world because\\nof\\nour sins.\\n15. Neither\\nis\\nthere\\nat\\nthis\\ntime\\nprince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt\\noffering,\\nor\\nsacrifice,\\nor\\noblation,\\nor\\nincense,\\nor\\nplace\\nto\\nsacrifice\\nbefore\\nthee, and to find mercy.\\n16. Nevertheless in a contrite heart\\nand an humble\\nspirit\\nlet\\nus\\nbe\\nac-\\ncepted.\\n17. Like\\nas\\nin\\nthe burnt\\nofferings\\nof rams and bullocks, and\\nlike\\nas in\\nten thousands of fat lambs:\\nso let our\\nsacrifice be in thy sight this day, and\\ngrant\\nthat we may\\nwholly go\\nafter\\nthee: for they shall not be confounded\\nthat put their trust in thee.\\n18. And now we follow thee with\\nall our heart, we fear thee, and seek\\nthy face.\\n19. Put us not to shame: but deal\\nwith us after thy lovingkindness, and\\naccording\\nto\\nthe\\nmultitude\\nof\\nthy\\nmercies.\\n20. Deliver us also according to thy\\nmarvellous\\nworks, and\\ngive\\nglory\\nto\\nthy name, O Lord : and\\nlet\\nall them\\nthat do thy servants hurt be ashamed\\n;\\n21. And let them be confounded in\\nall\\ntheir power and\\nmight, and\\nlet\\ntheir strength be broken;\\n22. And\\nlet them know\\nthat thou\\nart Lord, the only God, and glorious\\nover the whole world.\\n23. And\\nthe\\nking’s\\nservants,\\nthat\\nput them in, ceased not to make the\\noven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and\\nsmall wood;\\n24.

Amen.\\nvni\\nCHRISTIAMTY\\nChristianity grew out of Judaism and the Christians claim many of\\nthe Jewish sacred writings as their own. The Christian Bible contains\\nboth the Old Testament and the New Testament while many editions\\nof the Bible include also the books of the Apocrypha.\\nThe Christian Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, was\\na Jew, steeped\\nin\\nJewish tradition and culture. He was reared according to the customs\\nof the Jewish community of the first century and knew, as well as did\\nany Jewish youth of his day, the law and the prophets. He was proud\\nof\\nthis, and assured his followers that his mission was not to destroy\\nthis law, but to fulfil\\nit. He thought of himself as standing in the line\\nof the prophets, of giving a true interpretation of that which they had.\\nsought to put into words and deeds. For him, his teaching was merely\\nthe next step in a growing\\ntradition\\nthat had begun with Abraham\\nand had continued down to his day.\\nThis next step for Jesus and his followers was to break away from\\nthe narrow nationalism of the Judaism of the past and\\nto carry the\\nhigh\\nethical\\nidealism\\nof\\nthe greatest\\nof\\nthe prophets to\\nall people,\\nwhether Jew or non-Jew. Jesus taught first among the Jews, but later\\nturned to the Gentiles. His was a gospel for all men.\\n‘Tf I be\\nlifted\\nup,” he said, \\'T shall draw all men unto me”.\\nThe first four books of the New Testament—^Matthew, Mark, Luke,\\nand John—are four efforts\\nto interpret his\\nlife historically. They re-\\ncount, in so far as that was possible\\nin those days, the\\nlife\\nof Jesus,\\nThe fifth book\\nis the story of the followers of Jesus after his death. It\\ntells\\nof\\nthe founding\\nof the Christian church by a\\nsmall body\\nof\\nins followers.\\nThe remainder of the books of the New Testament, except the last,\\nare letters written by early Christians. Most of these were written by\\nSaint\\nPaul,\\nthe\\nfirst\\nChristian\\nmissionary,\\nto\\nchurches\\nwhich\\nhe\\nfounded or to friends in these churches. As such, they are important\\nstatements of what this new faith, Christianity, meant to Paul. Some\\nof these letters are written by authors whose names have been lost.\\n227\\n228\\nCHRISTIANITY\\nRevelation the last book of the New Testament^\\nis an example of\\nthe mass of Apocalyptic\\nliterature which was\\ncirculated among the\\nearly churches. It\\nis an account of a vision experienced by one John\\nand\\nis written in symbolic language\\nto which many interpretations\\ncan be given.\\nThese books, along with many others, were circulated among the\\nearly Christian churches and treasured by them. Often churches ex-\\nchanged books and they were read to the members. As time went on a\\nneed was felt for some authoritative collection of this literature. Thus\\nearly scholars attempted to pick out of\\nthis great mass of\\nliterature\\nthose documents which they believed to be authentic products of the\\nearliest years of the church. After many such attempts, leaders of the\\nearly church decided upon a canon or authentic group of books that\\nwould officially constitute the New Testament. These are the books to\\nbe found in any standard version of the New Testament.\\nHowever,\\nthere\\nare many other books stemming from\\nthis\\nearly\\nChristian period, which are studied by scholars as throwing some light\\nupon the early church and the doctrines\\nof\\nChristianity. These are\\npublished separately from the Bible and are usually available only to\\nscholars. Among these are the New Testament Apocrypha, the Sayings\\nof Jesus, the writings to which were attached the names of Jesus’ dis-\\nciples\\nto give them an appearance of having been written by these\\nmen, and numerous other documents. None of these writings are con-\\nsidered authentic enough to become part of the New Testament canon\\nand are thus not among the sacred writings of the Christians.\\nChristianity, growing out of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and\\ndeveloping into a religious movement in the Roman Empire, was first\\npersecuted vigorously by Roman authorities. But its strength was such\\nthat it eventually conquered the Empire and became the only religion\\npermitted by the Emperor Constantine. With the fall of the Roman\\nEmpire, Roman Christianity came to dominate Europe and, from there,\\nto spread throughout the world. Its missionary activities have carried\\nit to all parts of the globe,\\ncivilized and\\nuncivilized. The Bible has\\nbeen translated into more than 1,000 languages and today\\nit\\nis\\nesti-\\nmated that over 585,000,000 persons in the world belong to the various\\nbranches\\nof\\nthe\\nChristian\\nchurch.\\nThis forms\\nthe\\nlargest\\nreligious\\ngroup in the world.\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\nThe New Testament\\nis the sacred book of the Christians. Although it\\nis referred to as a “book’Vit\\nis actually a collection of twenty-seven\\nbooks or writings. These writings were chosen from a mass of docu-\\nments which circulated among the early Christian churches and be-\\ncame the canon of the Christians.\\nAll of these writings first appeared in the Greek language but have\\nbeen\\ntranslated\\ninto\\nalmost\\nevery known\\nlanguage\\nof\\nthe\\nworld.\\nNumerous versions are available in English today. The most widely\\nknown English version is that translated early in the seventeenth cen-\\ntury by order of King James of England, which is referred to as the\\nKing James Bible or the Authorized Version of the Bible.\\nOf course, the original manuscripts of these books have been\\nlost\\nand the manuscripts now in existence are copies of copies. A few New\\nTestament manuscripts date back to the fourth and the fifth centu-\\nries while most of the manuscripts now known date from the fifth to\\nthe tenth centuries. There are more than 1,700 such manuscripts now\\nin existence in museums and in private collections. The oldest com-\\nplete manuscript of the New Testament is the Aleph or Sinaitic Codex\\nwhich dates from the middle of the fourth century after Christ. It was\\ndiscovered at Mount\\nSinai by Tischendorf in 1859 and now rests in\\nthe Imperial Library at Moscow, Russia.\\nhe was\\nset,\\nhis\\ndisciples\\ncame unto\\nhim:\\n2. And he opened\\nhis mouth, and\\ntaught them, saying,\\n3.\\nBlessed are the poor in spirit : for\\ntheirs\\nis the kingdom\\nof heaven.\\n4.\\nBlessed are they that mourn :\\nfor\\nthey shall be comforted.\\n5.\\nBlessed\\nare the meek:\\nfor they\\nshall inherit the earth.\\n6.\\nBlessed are they which do hunger\\nand thirst after righteousness :\\nfor they\\nshall be\\nfilled.\\n7.\\nBlessed are the merciful: for they\\nshall obtain mercy.\\n8.\\nBlessed\\nare\\nthe\\npure\\nin\\nheart:\\nfor they shall see God.\\n9-\\nBlessed are the peacemakers:\\nfor\\n229\\nThe Gospel According to\\nSt. Matthew\\nThis\\nfirst book\\nof\\nthe New\\nTesta-\\nment was probably written in Palestine\\nbetween\\n6o\\nand\\nyo\\nA.D.\\nby\\none\\nnamed\\nLevi\\nwho\\nwas\\noften\\ncalled\\nMatthew.\\nIt was\\nwritten\\nfor\\nJewish\\nChristians who wanted to know of the\\nevents in the\\nlife of Jesus.

Think not that\\nI am come\\nto\\ndestroy the law, or the prophets :\\nI am\\nnot come to destroy, but to fulfil.\\n18. For verily\\nI say unto you,\\nTill\\nheaven and earth pass, one jot or one\\ntittle\\nshall in no wise\\npass from the\\nlaw,\\ntill\\nall be fulfilled.\\n19. Whosoever therefore shall break\\none of these least commandments, and\\nshall teach men\\nso, he shall be called\\nthe\\nleast in the kingdom of heaven:\\nbut\\nwhosoever\\nshall\\ndo\\nand\\nteach\\nthem, the same shall be called great in\\nthe kingdom of heaven.\\n20.

Ye have heard that it was said\\nby them of old time. Thou shalt not\\nkill; and whosoever shall\\nkill shall be\\nin danger of the judgment:\\n22. But\\nI say unto you, That who-\\nsoever\\nis angry with his brother with-\\nout a cause\\nshall be in danger of the\\njudgment;\\nand\\nwhosoever\\nshall\\nsay\\nto his brother, Raca,\\nshall be in dan-\\nger\\nof\\nthe\\ncouncil\\n:\\nbut\\nwhosoever\\nshall\\nsay, Thou\\nfool, shall be in dan-\\nger of hell\\nfire.\\n23. Therefore\\nif thou bring thy gift\\nto\\nthe\\naltar, and\\nthere\\nrememberest\\nthat thy\\nbrother hath ought\\nagainst\\nthee;\\n24.

Verily\\nI\\nsay unto\\nthee, Thou\\nshalt by no means come out\\nthence,\\ntill thou hast paid the uttermost\\nfar-\\nthing.\\n27. Ye have heard that\\nit was said\\nby them\\nof old\\ntime.

That ye may be the children of\\nyour Father which\\nis\\nin heaven:\\nfor\\nhe maketh his sun to\\nrise on the evil\\nand on the good, and sendeth rain on\\nthe just and on the unjust.\\n46.

But when ye pray, use not vain\\nrepetitions,\\nas\\nthe\\nheathen\\ndo;\\nfor\\nthey\\nthink\\nthat\\nthey\\nshall\\nbe heard\\nfor their much speaking.\\n8. Be\\nnot\\nye\\ntherefore\\nlike\\nunto\\nthem:\\nfor your Father knoweth what\\nthings ye have need\\nof, before ye ask\\nhim,\\n9. After this manner therefore pray\\nye; Our Father which art in heavenj\\nHallowed be thy name.\\n232\\nCHRISTIANITY\\n10. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be\\ndone in earth, as\\nit\\nis in heaven.\\n1 1 . Give\\nus\\nthis\\nday\\nour\\ndaily\\nbread.\\n12. And forgive us our debts, as we\\nforgive our debtors.\\n13. And\\nlead\\nus\\nnot\\ninto\\ntempta-\\ntion,\\nbut\\ndeliver\\nus\\nfrom\\nevil:\\nFor\\nthine\\nis the kingdom, and the power,\\nand the glory, for ever. Amen,\\n14. For\\nif\\nye\\nforgive\\nmen\\ntheir\\ntrespasses, your heavenly Father\\nwill\\nalso forgive you\\n:\\n15. But\\nif ye forgive not men their\\ntrespasses,\\nneither\\nwill\\nyour\\nFather\\nforgive your trespasses.\\n16. Moreover when ye fast, be not,\\nas\\nthe\\nhypocrites,\\nof\\na\\nsad\\ncounte-\\nnance:\\nfor they\\ndisfigure\\ntheir\\nfaces,\\nthat\\nthey may\\nappear\\nunto men\\nto\\nfast. Verily I say unto you, They have\\ntheir reward.\\n17. But\\nthou,\\nwhen\\nthou\\nfastest,\\nanoint thine head, and wash thy face;\\n18. That thou appear not unto men\\nto\\nfast, but unto thy Father which\\nis\\nin secret: and thy Father, which seeth\\nin secret, shall reward thee openly.\\n19. Lay not up for yourselves treas-\\nures upon earth, where moth and rust\\ndoth corrupt, and where thieves break\\nthrough and steal\\n:\\n20. But lay up for yourselves treas-\\nures\\nin\\nheaven,\\nwhere\\nneither moth\\nnor\\nrust\\ndoth\\ncorrupt,\\nand\\nwhere\\nthieves do not break through nor steal :\\n21. For where your treasure is, there\\nwill your heart be also.\\n22. The\\nlight\\nof\\nthe\\nbody\\nis\\nthe\\neye:\\nif\\ntherefore\\nthine eye be\\nsingle,\\nthy whole body shall be\\nfull of\\nlight.\\n23. But\\nif\\nthine\\neye\\nbe\\nevil,\\nthy\\nwhole body\\nshall be\\nfull\\nof darkness.\\nIf therefore\\nthe\\nlight\\nthat\\nis\\nin thee\\nbe\\ndarkness, how\\ngreat\\nis\\nthat dark-\\nness!\\n24. No man can serve two masters:\\nfor\\neither he\\nwill hate\\nthe\\none, and\\nlove the other; or else he will hold to\\nthe one, and despise the other. Ye can-\\nnot serve God and mammon.\\n25. Therefore I say unto you. Take\\nno thought for your life, what ye shall\\neat,\\nor what ye\\nshall\\ndrink; nor yet\\nfor your body, what ye\\nshall put on.\\nIs not\\nthe\\nlife more than meat, and\\nthe body than raiment?\\n26. Behold the fowls of the air:\\nfor\\nthey sow\\nnot,\\nneither\\ndo\\nthey\\nreap,\\nnor gather into barns; yet yOur heav-\\nenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not\\nmuch better than they ?\\n27. Which of you by taking thought\\ncan add one\\ncubit\\nlinto\\nhis\\nstature?\\n28. And why\\ntake\\nye\\nthought\\nfor\\nraiment?\\nConsider\\nthe\\nlilies\\nof\\nthe\\nfield, how\\nthey grow;\\nthey\\ntoil\\nnot,\\nneither do they spin:\\n29. And yet\\nI say unto you, That\\neven Solomon in all his glory was not\\narrayed like one of these.\\n.\\n30. Wherefore, if God so clothe the\\ngrass of the field, which to day is, and\\nto morrow\\nis cast into the oven, shall\\nhe not much more clothe you, O ye of\\nlittle faith?\\n31. Therefore take no thought, say-\\ning, What shall we eat? or. What shall\\nwe\\ndrink?\\nor,\\nWherewithal\\nshall we\\nbe clothed?\\n32.\\n(For\\nafter\\nall\\nthese\\nthings do\\nthe Gentiles seek:)\\nfor your heavenly\\nFather knoweth that ye have need of\\nall these things.\\n33. But seek ye first the kingdom of\\nGod, and\\nhis\\nrighteousness; and\\nall\\nthese things shall be added unto you.\\n34. Take\\ntherefore no thought for\\nthe\\nmorrow:\\nfor\\nthe\\nmorrow\\nshall\\ntake thought for the things\\nof\\nitself.\\nSufiicient\\nunto\\nthe\\nday\\nis\\nthe\\nevil\\nthereof.\\nChapter\\n7\\n1. Judge not, that ye be not judged.\\n2. For\\nwith\\nwhat\\njudgment\\nye\\njudge, ye\\nshall be judged:\\nand with\\nwhat\\nmeasure\\nye\\nmete,\\nit\\nshall\\nbe\\nmeasured to you again.\\n3. And why beholdest thou the mote\\nthat is in thy brother’s eye, but consid-\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n233\\nerest not\\nthe beam\\nthat\\nis\\nin\\nthine\\nown eye?\\n4. Or how\\nwilt\\nthou\\nsay\\nto\\nthy\\nbrother. Let me pull out the mote out\\nof thine eye ; and, behold, a beam is in\\nthine own eye?\\n5. Thou hypocrite,\\nfirst cast out the\\nbeam out of thine own eye; and then\\nshalt thou\\nsee\\nclearly\\nto\\ncast out the\\nmote out of thy brother’s eye.\\n6. Give not that which\\nis holy unto\\n(Jogs, neither\\ncast ye your\\npearls\\nbefore\\nswine,\\nlest\\nthey trample them\\nunder their\\nfeet, and turn again and\\nrend you.\\n7. Ask, and\\nit\\nshall be given you;\\nseek, and ye shall find; knock, and\\nit\\nshall be opened unto you:\\n8. For\\nevery\\none\\nthat:\\nasketh\\nre-\\nceiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;\\nand\\nto him that knocketh it shall be\\nopened.\\n9. Or what man\\nis\\nthere\\nof\\nyou,\\nwhom\\nif\\nhis\\nson\\nask\\nbread,\\nwill he\\ngive him a stone?\\n10. Or if he ask a fish, will he give\\nhim a serpent?\\n11.\\nIf\\nye\\nthen,\\nbeing\\nevil,\\nknow\\nhow to give good gifts unto your chil-\\ndren,\\nhow\\nmuch\\nmore\\nshall\\nyour\\nFather which\\nis in heaven give good\\nthings to them that ask him?\\n12. Therefore all things whatsoever\\nye would that men should do to you,\\ndo ye even so to them: for this\\nis the\\nlaw and the prophets.\\n13. Enter ye in\\nat\\nthe\\nstrait\\ngate:\\nfor wide\\nis the gate, and broad\\nis the\\nway, that leadeth\\nto\\ndestruction, and\\nmany there be which go in thereat:\\n14. Because\\nstrait\\nis the\\ngate, and\\nnarrow\\nis the way, which leadeth unto\\nlife, and few there be that find\\nit*\\n15. Beware of false prophets, which\\ncome\\nto you\\nin sheep’s\\nclothing, but\\ninwardly they are ravening wolves.\\n16. Ye\\nshall know them\\nby\\ntheir\\nfruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns,\\nor figs of thistles ?\\n17. Even so every good tree bring-\\neth\\nforth\\ngood\\nfruit; but a\\ncorrupt\\ntree bringeth forth evil fruit.\\n18. A good tree cannot bring forth\\nevil\\nfruit,\\nneither can a corrupt\\ntree\\nbring forth good fruit.\\n19. Every\\ntree\\nthat\\nbringeth\\nnot\\nforth\\ngood\\nfruit\\nis hewn down, and\\ncast into the fire.\\n20.\\nWherefore\\nby\\ntheir\\nfruits\\nye\\nshall know them.\\n21. Not every one\\nthat\\nsaith unto\\nme, Lord, Lord,\\nshall enter into the\\nkingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth\\nthe\\nwill\\nof my\\nFather which\\nis\\nin\\nheaven,\\n22. Many will say to me in that day.\\nLord,\\nLord, have we not prophesied\\nin thy name ? and\\nin thy name have\\ncast out devils? and in thy name done\\nmany wonderful works?\\n23. And\\nthen\\nwill\\nI\\nprofess\\nunto\\nthem, I never knew you: depart from\\nme, ye that work iniquity.\\n24. Therefore\\nwhosoever\\nheareth\\nthese sayings of mine, and doeth them,\\nI\\nwill\\nliken\\nhim unto\\na\\nwise man,\\nwhich built his house upon a rock:\\n25. And\\nthe\\nrain\\ndescended,\\nand\\nthe floods came, and the winds blew,\\nand beat upon that house; and\\nit fell\\nnot:\\nfor\\nit was founded upon a rock.\\n26. And\\nevery\\none\\nthat\\nheareth\\nthese sayings of mine, and doeth them\\nnot,\\nshall be\\nlikened unto\\na\\nfoolish\\nman, which built his house upon the\\nsand:\\n27. And\\nthe\\nrain\\ndescended, and\\nthe floods came, and the winds blew,\\nand beat upon that house; and it fell:\\nand great was the fall of\\nit.\\n28. And\\nit\\ncame\\nto\\npass,\\nwhen\\nJesus\\nhad\\nended\\nthese\\nsayings,\\nthe\\npeople\\nwere\\nastonished\\nat\\nhis\\ndoC’\\ntrine:\\n29. For he taught them as one hav-\\ning authority, and not\\nas the\\nscribes.\\nChapter 9\\n20- And, behold,\\na woman, which\\nwas diseased\\nwith an\\nissue\\nof blood\\n234\\nCHRISTIANITY\\ntwelve\\nyearSj came behind\\nhim, and\\ntouched the hem of his garment:\\n21. For she said within herself, If I\\nmay but touch his garment, I shall be\\nwhole.\\n22. But\\nJesus\\nturned\\nhim\\nabout,\\nand when he saw her, he said, Daugh-\\nter,\\nbe\\nof\\ngood\\ncomfort;\\nthy\\nfaith\\nhath\\nmade\\nthee\\nwhole.\\nAnd\\nthe\\nwoma*n\\nwas made\\nwhole\\nfrom\\nthat\\nhour.\\n23. And when Jesus came into the\\nruler’s\\nhouse, and saw\\nthe\\nminstrels\\nand the people making a noise,\\n24. He said unto them, Give place:\\nfor the maid\\nis not dead, but\\nsleep-\\neth. And they laughed him to scorn.\\n25. But when the people were put\\nforth, he went in, and took her by the\\nhand, and the maid arose.\\n26. And\\nthe\\nfame\\nhereof\\nwent\\nabroad into\\nall that land.\\n27. And\\nwhen\\nJesus\\ndeparted\\nthence, two blind men followed him,\\ncrying, and saying. Thou son of David,\\nhave mercy on us.\\n28. And when he was come into the\\nhouse,\\nthe\\nblind men came\\nto him:\\nand Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye\\nthat I am able to do this? They said\\nunto him. Yea, Lord.\\n29. Then touched he their eyes, say-\\ning, According to your faith be it unto\\nyou.\\n30. And\\ntheir\\neyes\\nwere\\nopened;\\nand Jesus\\nstraitly charged them,\\nsay-\\ning, See that no man know\\nit.\\n31. But\\nthey, when they were\\nde-\\nparted, spread abroad his fame in all\\nthat country.\\n32. As they went out, behold, they\\nbrought to him a dumb man possessed\\nwith a devil.\\n33. And when\\nthe\\ndevil was\\ncast\\nout, the dumb spake: and the multi-\\ntudes marvelled,\\nsaying.\\nIt was never\\nso seen in Israel.\\n34. But the Pharisees said. He cast-\\neth out\\ndevils through the prince of\\nthe devils.\\nChapter 10\\n16. Behold,\\nI\\nsend\\nyou\\nforth\\nas\\nsheep\\nin the midst of wolves:\\nbe ye\\ntherefore wise\\nas serpents, and harm-\\nless as doves.\\n17. But beware\\nof men:\\nfor\\nthey\\nwill\\ndeliver you up\\nto\\nthe\\ncouncils,\\nand\\nthey\\nwill\\nscourge\\nyou\\nin\\ntheir\\nsynagogues;\\n18. And ye shall be brought before\\ngovernors and\\nkings for my sake, for\\na\\ntestimony\\nagainst\\nthem\\nand\\nthe\\n.Gentiles.\\n19. But when they\\ndeliver you up,\\ntake no thought how or what ye shall\\nspeak: for it shall be given you in that\\nsame hour what ye shall speak.\\n20. For it\\nis not ye that speak, but\\nthe Spirit of your Father which speak-\\neth in you.\\n21. And\\nthe\\nbrother\\nshall\\ndeliver\\nup the brother to death, and the father\\nthe child\\n: and the children\\nshall\\nrise\\nup\\nagainst\\ntheir\\nparents,\\nand\\ncause\\nthem to be put to death.\\n22. And ye shall be hated of all men\\nfor my name’s sake\\n:\\nbut he that en-\\ndureth to the end shall be saved.\\n23. But when\\nthey\\npersecute\\nyou\\nin this\\ncity,\\nflee ye into another:\\nfor\\nverily\\nI\\nsay unto\\nyou, Ye\\nshall not\\nhave gone over the cities of Israel,\\ntill\\nthe Son of man be come.\\n24. The\\ndisciple\\nis\\nnot\\nabove\\nhis\\nmaster, nor the servant above his lord.\\n25.\\nIt\\nis\\nenough\\nfor\\nthe\\ndisciple\\nthat he be as his master, and the serv-\\nant\\nas\\nhis\\nlord.\\nIf\\nthey have\\ncalled\\nthe\\nmaster\\nof\\nthe\\nhouse\\nBeelzebub,\\nhow much more shall\\nthey call them\\nof his household?\\n26. Fear\\nthem\\nnot\\ntherefore:\\nfor\\nthere\\nis\\nnothing\\ncovered,\\nthat\\nshall\\nnot be\\nrevealed; and\\nhid,\\nthat\\nshall\\nnot be known.\\n27. What\\nI\\ntell\\nyou\\nin\\ndarkness,\\nthat speak ye in\\nlight:\\nand what ye\\nhear in the\\near, that preach ye upon\\nthe house tops.\\n28. And\\nfear not them which\\nkill\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n235\\nthe body, but are not able to kill the\\nsoul: but rather fear him which is able\\nto destroy both soul and body in hell\\n29. Are not two sparrows sold for a\\nfarthing? and one\\nof them\\nshall not\\nfall\\non\\nthe\\nground\\nwithout\\nyour\\nFather.\\n30. But the very hairs of your head\\nare all numbered.\\n31. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of\\nmore value than many sparrows.\\n32. Whosoever\\ntherefore\\nshall con-\\nfess me before men, him will I confess\\nalso\\nbefore my\\nFather\\nwhich\\nis\\nin\\nheaven.\\n33. But\\nwhosoever\\nshall\\ndeny me\\nbefore men, him will\\nI\\nalso deny be-\\nfore my Father which\\nis in heaven.\\n34. Think not\\nthat\\nI am come\\nto\\nsend peace on\\nearth:\\nI came not\\nto\\nsend peace, but a sword.\\n35. For I am come to set a man at\\nvariance\\nagainst\\nhis\\nfather, and\\nthe\\ndaughter against her mother, and the\\ndaughter in law against her mother in\\nlaw.\\n36. And a man’s foes\\nshall be they\\nof his own household.\\n37. He that loveth father or mother\\nmore than me\\nis not worthy of me:\\nand he\\nthat\\nloveth\\nson\\nor\\ndaughter\\nmore than me\\nis not worthy of me.\\n38. And\\nhe\\nthat\\ntaketh\\nnot\\nhis\\ncross, and\\nfollowcth\\nafter me,\\nis not\\nworthy of me.\\n39. He that findeth his life shall lose\\nit: and he that loseth his life for my\\nsake shall find\\nit.\\n40. He\\nthat\\nreceiveth you\\nreceiv-\\neth me, and he that receiveth me re-\\nceiveth him that sent me.\\n41. He that receiveth a prophet in\\nthe name of a prophet shall receive a\\nprophet’s reward; and he that receiv-\\neth a righteous man in the name of a\\nrighteous man shall receive a righteous\\nman’s reward.\\n42. And\\nwhosoever\\nshall\\ngive\\nto\\ndrink unto one of these\\nlittle ones a\\ncup of cold water only in the name of\\na\\ndisciple,\\nverily\\nI\\nsay unto you, he\\nshall in no wise lose his reward.\\nChapter\\n11\\n25. At\\nthat\\ntime\\nJesus\\nanswered\\nand\\nsaid,\\nI\\nthank\\nthee, O\\nFather,\\nLord\\nof\\nheaven\\nand\\nearth,\\nbecause\\nthou\\nhast hid\\nthese\\nthings from\\nthe\\nwise and\\nprudent, and\\nhast revealed\\nthem unto babes.\\n26. Even\\nso,\\nFather:\\nfor\\nso\\nit\\nseemed good in thy sight.\\n27.\\nAll\\nthings\\nare\\ndelivered\\nunto\\nme of my Father: and no man know-\\neth the Son, but the Father; neither\\nknoweth\\nany man\\nthe\\nFather,\\nsave\\nthe\\nSon,\\nand he\\nto whomsoever\\nthe\\nSon will reveal him.\\n28. Come unto me,\\nall ye that\\nla-\\nbour and are heavy laden, and\\nI will\\ngive you\\nrest.\\n29. Take my yoke upon\\nyou, and\\nlearn of me; for I am meek and lowly\\nin heart :\\nand ye\\nshall find\\nrest unto\\nyour souls.\\n30. For my yoke\\nis\\neasy, and my\\nburden is light.\\nChapter\\n12\\n31. Wherefore\\nI\\nsay unto you, All\\nmanner of sin and blasphemy shall be\\nforgiven unto men: but the blasphemy\\nagainst the Holy Ghost\\nshall\\nnot be\\nforgiven unto men.\\n32. And whosoever speaketh a word\\nagainst\\nthe Son\\nof man,\\nit\\nshall\\nbe\\nforgiven him : but whosoever speaketh\\nagainst the Holy Ghost,\\nit\\nshall\\nnot\\nbe forgiven him, neither in this world,\\nneither in the world to come.\\n33.\\nEither make the tree good, and\\nhis fruit good; or\\nelse make the tree\\ncorrupt, and his fruit corrupt:\\nfor the\\ntree is known by his fruit.\\n34. O\\ngeneration\\nof\\nvipers,\\nhow\\ncan ye, being evil, speak good things?\\nfor out of the abundance of the heart\\nthe mouth speaketh.\\n35. A good man\\nout\\nof\\nthe good\\n236\\nCHRISTIANITY\\ntreasure\\nof\\nthe\\nheart\\nbringeth\\nforth\\ngood things:\\nand an\\nevil man out of\\nthe\\nevil\\ntreasure\\nbringeth\\nforth\\nevil\\nthings.\\n36. But\\nI say unto you. That every\\nidle word that men\\nshall speak, they\\nshall give account thereof in the day\\nof judgment.\\n37. For by thy words thou shalt be\\njustified, and by thy words thou shalt\\nbe condemned.\\n38. Then certain of the scribes and\\nof\\nthe\\nPharisees\\nanswered,\\nsaying,\\nMaster, we\\nwould\\nsee\\na\\nsign\\nfrom\\nthee.\\n39. But he answered and said unto\\nthem, An\\nevil and adulterous genera-\\ntion\\nseeketh\\nafter a\\nsign ; and\\nthere\\nshall no\\nsign be given\\nto\\nit, but the\\nsign of the prophet Jonas:\\n40. For\\nas\\nJonas\\nwas\\nthree\\ndays\\nand three nights in the whale’s belly;\\nso shall the Son of man be three days\\nand\\nthree nights in the heart of\\nthe\\nearth.\\n41. The men of.Nineveh shall\\nrise\\nin judgment with this generation, and\\nshall condemn\\nit:\\nbecause\\nthey\\nre-\\npented at the preaching of Jonas ; and,\\nbehold, a greater than Jonas\\nis here.\\n42. The queen\\nof\\nthe\\nsouth\\nshall\\nrise up in the judgment with this gen-\\neration, and shall condemn it:\\nfor she\\ncame from the uttermost parts of the\\nearth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;\\nand, behold, a greater than Solomon\\nIS here.\\n43. When the unclean spirit is gone\\nout\\nof\\na man,\\nhe\\nwalketh\\nthrough\\ndry\\nplaces,\\nseeking\\nrest, and\\nfindeth\\nnone.\\n44. Then he saith, I will return into\\nmy house from whence\\nI came out;\\nand when he\\nis come, he\\nfindeth\\nit\\nempty, swept, and garnished,\\n45. Then goeth he, and taketh with\\nhimself\\nseven\\nother\\nspirits\\nmore\\nwicked than\\nhimself, and\\nthey\\nenter\\nin and dwell there: and the last state\\nof\\nthat man\\nis worse than\\nthe\\nfirst.\\nEven\\nso\\nshall\\nit be\\nalso\\nunto\\nthis\\nwicked generation.\\nChapter\\n13\\n1. The same day went Jesus out of\\nthe house, and\\nsat by the sea side.\\n2. And great multitudes were gath-\\nered\\ntogether\\nunto\\nhim,\\nso\\nthat he\\nwent\\ninto\\na\\nship, and\\nsat; and\\nthe\\nwhole multitude stood on the shore.\\n3. And he spake many things unto\\nthem\\nin\\nparables,\\nsaying,\\nBehold, a\\nsower went forth to sow;\\n4. And when he sowed, some seeds\\nfell by\\nthe way\\nside, and\\nthe\\nfowls\\ncame and devoured them up:\\n5. Some\\nfell\\nupon\\nstony\\nplaces,,\\nwhere they had not much earth: and\\nforthwith\\nthey\\nsprung\\nup,\\nbecause\\nthey had no deepness of earth:\\n6. And when the sun was up, they\\nwere scorched; and because they had\\nno root, they withered away.\\n7. And some fell among thorns; and\\nthe\\nthorns\\nsprung\\nup,\\nand\\nchoked\\nthem:\\n8. But other\\nfell into good ground,\\nand brought forth fruit, some an hun-\\ndredfold* some\\nsixtyfold, some\\nthirty-\\nfold.\\n9. Who hath\\nears to\\nhear,\\nlet him\\nhear.\\n10. And\\nthe\\ndisciples\\ncame,\\nand\\nsaid\\nunto\\nhim. Why\\nspeakest\\nthou\\nunto them in parables?\\n11. He\\nanswered\\nand\\nsaid\\nunto\\nthem. Because\\nit\\nis given unto you to\\nknow the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given.\\n12. For\\nwhosoever\\nhath,\\nto\\nhim\\nshall be given, and he shall have more\\nabundance:\\nbut whosoever hath\\nnot,\\nfrom him\\nshall be\\ntaken away\\neven\\nthat he hath.\\n13. Therefore\\nspeak\\nI\\nto them\\nin\\nparables: because they seeing see not;\\nand hearing they hear not, neither do\\nthey understand.\\n14. And\\nin\\nthem\\nis\\nfulfilled\\nthe\\nprophecy\\nof\\nEsaias, which\\nsai’th. By\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n237\\nhearing ye\\nshall\\nhear, and\\nshall\\nnot\\nunderstand; and\\nseeing ye\\nshall\\nsee,\\nand\\nshall not perceive:\\n15. For this people’s heart is waxed\\ngross* and their ears are dull of hear-\\ning, and\\ntheir eyes they have\\nclosed;\\nlest at any time they should\\nsee with\\ntheir\\neyes, and\\nhear with\\ntheir\\nears,\\nand\\nshould\\nunderstand\\nwith\\ntheir\\nheart, and should be\\nconverted, and\\nI should heal them.\\n16. But blessed\\nare\\nyour\\neyes,\\nfor\\nthey see: and your ears, for they hear.\\n17. For verily I say unto you. That\\nmany\\nprophets\\nand\\nrighteous\\nmen\\nhave desired to see those things which\\nye see, and have not seen them, and\\nto hear\\nthose\\nthings which\\nye\\nhear,\\nand have not heard them.\\n18. Hear ye\\ntherefore\\nthe\\nparable\\nof the sower.\\n19. When any one heareth the word\\nof the kingdom, and understandeth it\\nnot, then cometh the wicked one, and\\ncatcheth away\\nthat which was sown\\nin his heart. This is he which received\\nseed by the way side.\\n20. But he\\nthat\\nreceived\\nthe\\nseed\\ninto stony places, the same is he that\\nheareth the word, and anon with joy\\nreceiveth it;\\n21. Yet hath he not root in himself,\\nbut\\ndureth\\nfor\\na\\nwhile:\\nfor when\\ntribulation or persecution\\nariseth be-\\ncause\\nof the word, by and by he\\nis\\noffended.\\n22. He\\nalso\\nthat\\nreceived\\nseed\\namong the\\nthorns\\nis he\\nthat heareth\\nthe word ; and the care of this world,\\nand the deceitfulncss of riches, choke\\nthe word, and he becometh unfruitful.\\n23. But he\\nthat received seed\\ninto\\nthe\\ngood ground\\nis he\\nthat heareth\\nthe word, and understandeth it; which\\nalso heareth fruit, and bringeth forth,\\nsome an hundredfold, some sixty, some\\nthirty.\\n24. Another\\nparable put\\nhe\\nforth\\nunto\\nthem,\\nsaying, The\\nkingdom\\nof\\nheaven\\nis likened unto a man which\\nsowed good seed in his held\\n:\\n25. But while men slept, his enemy\\ncame\\nand\\nsowed\\ntares\\namong\\nthe\\nwheat, and went his way.\\n26. But when the blade was sprung\\nup,\\nand\\nbrought\\nforth\\nfruit,\\nthen\\nappeared the tares also.\\n27. So\\nthe\\nservants\\nof\\nthe\\nhouse-\\nholder came and\\nsaid unto him,\\nSir,\\ndidst not thou sow good\\nseed in thy\\nfield? from whence then hath it tares?\\n28. He\\nsaid unto them, An enemy\\nhath\\ndone\\nthis.\\nThe\\nservants\\nsaid\\nunto him. Wilt thou then that we go\\nand gather them up?\\n29. But he\\nsaid, Nay;\\nlest while ye\\ngather up\\nthe\\ntares, ye root up\\nalso\\nthe wheat with them.\\n30. Let\\nboth\\ngrow\\ntogether\\nuntil\\nthe harvest : and in the time of harvest\\nI will say to the reapers, Gather ye to-\\ngether\\nfirst the\\ntares, and bind them\\nin bundles\\nto burn them :\\nbut gather\\nthe wheat into my barn.\\n31. Another\\nparable put\\nhe\\nforth\\nunto them,\\nsaying. The kingdom\\nof\\nheaven\\nis\\nlike\\nto\\na grain\\nof mustard\\nseed, which a man\\ntook, and sowed\\nin his field:\\n32. Which indeed\\nis the least of all\\nseeds:\\nbut when\\nit is grown,\\nit\\nis the\\ngreatest among\\nherbs, and becometh\\na\\ntree,\\nso\\nthat\\nthe\\nbirds\\nof\\nthe\\nair\\ncome and lodge in the branches there-\\nof.\\n33. Another parable spake he unto\\nthem; The kingdom of heaven\\nis like\\nunto leaven, which a woman took, and\\nhid in three measures of meal,\\ntill the\\nwhole was leavened.\\n34.\\nAll\\nthese\\nthings\\nspake\\nJesus\\nunto\\nthe\\nmultitude\\nin parables; and\\nwithout a parable spake he not unto\\nthem:\\n35. That it might be fulfilled which\\nwas spoken by the prophet,\\nsaying,\\nI\\nwill open my mouth in parables; I will\\nutter\\nthings\\nwhich\\nhave\\nbeen\\nkept\\nsecret\\nfrom\\nthe\\nfoundation\\nof\\nthe\\nworld.\\n36. Then\\nJesus sent\\nthe multitude\\naway, and went\\ninto the house:\\nand\\n238\\nCHRISTIANITY\\nhis\\ndisciples came\\nunto\\nhim,\\nsaying,\\nDeclare\\nunto\\nus\\nthe\\nparable\\nof\\nthe\\ntares of the field.\\n37. He\\nanswered\\nand\\nsaid\\nunto\\nthem, He that soweth the good seed is\\nthe Son of man ;\\n38. The field is the world; the good\\nseed are the children of the kingdom\\n;\\nbut the\\ntares are the children of the\\nwicked one\\n;\\n39. The enemy that sowed them\\nis\\nthe\\ndevil;\\nthe\\nharvest\\nis\\nthe end\\nof\\nthe\\nworld; and\\nthe\\nreapers\\nare\\nthe\\nangels.\\n40. As therefore the tares are gath-\\nered and burned in the\\nfire ;\\nso\\nshall\\nit be in the end of this world.\\n41. The Son of man shall send forth\\nhis\\nangels, and they\\nshall gather out\\nof his kingdom\\nall things that offend,\\nand them which do iniquity ;\\n42. And shall cast them into a fur-\\nnace\\nof\\nfire :\\nthere\\nshal*\\nbe\\nwailing\\nand gnashing of teeth.\\n43. Then\\nshall the righteous shine\\n\\' forth\\nas\\nthe\\nsun\\nin\\nthe kingdom\\nof\\ntheir Father. Who hath ears\\nto hear,\\nlet him hear.\\n44. Again, the kingdom of heaven\\nis like unto treasure hid in a field ; the\\nwhich when\\na man hath\\nfound, he\\nhideth, and for joy thereof goeth and\\nselleth\\nall\\nthat he hath, and buyeth\\nthat\\nfield.\\n45. Again,\\nthe kingdom of heaven\\nis\\nlike unto a merchant man, seeking\\ngoodly pearls:\\n46. Who, when he had found one\\npearl of great price, went and sold all\\nthat he had, and bought\\nit.\\n47. Again,\\nthe kingdom of heaven\\nis\\nlike unto a net, that was cast into\\nthe\\nsea, and gathered\\nof every kind:,\\n48. Which, when\\nit was\\nfull,\\nthey\\ndrew to shore, and sat down, and gath-\\nered\\nthe\\ngood\\ninto\\nvessels,\\nbut\\ncast\\nthe bad away.\\n49. So shall it be at the end of the\\nworld:\\nthe\\nangels\\nshall come\\nforth,\\nand sever the wicked from among the\\njust.\\n50. And\\nshall\\ncast them\\ninto\\nthe\\nfurnace of fire:\\nthere shall be wailing\\nand gnashing of teeth.\\n51. Jesus saith unto them, Have ye\\nunderstood\\nall these things? They say\\nunto him, Yea, Lord.\\n52. Then said he unto them. There-\\nfore\\nevery\\nscribe which\\nis\\ninstructed\\nunto\\nthe kingdom\\nof\\nheaven\\nis\\nlike\\nunto\\na man\\nthat\\nis an\\nhouseholder,\\nwhich bringeth forth out of his treas-\\nure things new and old.\\nChapter\\n15\\n10. And\\nhe\\ncalled\\nthe\\nmultitude,\\nand said unto them. Hear, and under-\\nstand :\\n11. Not that which goeth into the\\nmouth defileth a man; but that which\\ncometh\\nout\\nof the mouth,\\nthis\\ndefil-\\neth a man.\\n12. Then came\\nhis\\ndisciples,\\nand\\nsaid unto him, Knowest thou that the\\nPharisees\\nwere\\noffended,\\nafter\\nthey\\nheard\\nthis saying?\\n13. But he answered and said. Every\\nplant, which my heavenly Father hath\\nnot planted, shall be rooted up.\\n14. Let them alone:\\nthey be blind\\nleaders of the blind. And\\nif the blind\\nlead the blind, both shall fall into the\\nditch.\\n15. Then answered Peter and said\\nunto him. Declare unto us this parable.\\n16. And Jesus said. Are ye also yet\\nwithout understanding?’\\n17. Do not ye yet understand, that\\nwhatsoever entereth in\\nat the mouth\\ngoeth into\\nthe\\nbelly, and\\nis\\ncast out\\ninto the draught?\\n18. But those things which proceed\\nout of the mouth come forth from the\\nheart; and they\\ndefile the man.\\n19. For out of the heart proceed evil\\nthoughts,\\nmurders,\\nadulteries,\\nfornh\\ncations,\\nthefts,\\nfalse witness, blasphe-\\nmies:\\n20. These are the things which de-\\nfile a man: but to eat with unwashen\\nhands defileth not a man.\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n239\\nChapter 16\\n13. When\\nJesus\\ncame\\ninto\\nthe\\ncoasts\\nof\\nCaesarea\\nPhilippi, he asked\\nhis\\ndisciples,\\nsaying, Whom do men\\nsay that I the Son of man am?\\n14. And\\nthey\\nsaid, Some\\nsay\\nthat\\nthou\\nart\\nJohn\\nthe\\nBaptist:\\nsome,\\nElias;\\nand\\nothers,\\nJeremias,\\nor\\none\\nof the prophets.\\n15. He saith unto them, But whom\\nsay ye that\\nI am ?\\n16. And Simon Peter answered and\\nsaid, Thou art the\\nChrist, the Son of\\nthe living God.\\n17. And\\nJesus\\nanswered\\nand\\nsaid\\nunto\\nhim,\\nBlessed\\nart\\nthou,\\nSimon\\nBarjona:\\nfor flesh and blood hath not\\nrevealed\\nit unto\\nthee, but my Father\\nwhich\\nis in heaven.\\n18. And I say also unto thee, That\\nthou\\nart\\nPeter,\\nand upon\\nthis\\nrock\\nTwill build my church; and the gates\\nof hell shall not prevail against\\nit.\\n19. And\\nI\\nwill give unto thee\\nthe\\nkeys of the kingdom of heaven:\\nand\\nwhatsoever thou\\nshalt bind on earth\\nshall be bound in heaven: and what-\\nsoever thou\\nshalt loose on earth shall\\nbe loosed in heaven.\\n20. Then\\ncharged he\\nhis\\ndisciples\\nthat they should\\ntell no man that he\\nwas Jesus the Christ.\\n21. From\\nthat\\ntime\\nforth\\nbegan\\nJesus\\nto shew unto\\nhis\\ndisciples, how\\nthat he must go unto Jerusalem, and\\nsuffer many\\nthings\\nof\\nthe\\nelders and\\nchief priests and scribes, and be killed,\\nand be raised again the third day.\\n22. Then\\nPeter\\ntook him, and be-\\ngan\\nto rebuke him, saying, Be\\nit far\\nfrom thee. Lord :\\nthis shall not be unto\\nthee.\\n23. But he\\nturned,\\nand\\nsaid\\nunto\\nPeter,\\nGet\\nthee\\nbehind\\nme,\\nSatan:\\nthou art an offence unto me:\\nfor thou\\nsavourest\\nnot\\nthe\\nthings\\nthat be\\nof\\nGod, but those that be of men.\\n24. Then\\nsaid\\nJesus unto\\nhis\\ndis-\\nciples, If any man will come after me.\\nlet him deny himself, and take up his\\ncross, and follow me,\\n25. For whosoever will save his\\nlife\\nshall lose\\nit: and whosoever will lose\\nhis\\nlife for my sake shall find\\nit.\\n26. For what\\nis a man profited,\\nif\\nhe\\nshall\\ngain\\nthe\\nwhole\\nworld, and\\nlose his own soul? or what shall a man\\ngive in exchange for his soul?\\n27. For the Son of man shall come\\nin\\nthe\\nglory\\nof\\nhis Father\\nwith\\nhis\\nangels; and then he shall reward every\\nman according to his works.\\n28. Verily I say unto you. There be\\nsome standing\\nhere, which\\nshall not\\ntaste of death,\\ntill they see the Son of\\nman coming in his kingdom.\\nChapter 18\\n1. At the same time came the\\ndis.\\nciples unto\\nJesus, saying. Who\\nis the\\ngreatest in the kingdom of heaven?\\n2. And\\nJesus\\ncalled\\na\\nlittle\\nchild\\nunto him, and set him in the midst of\\nthem,\\n3. And said. Verily I say unto you.\\nExcept ye be converted, and become\\nas\\nlittle\\nchildren,\\nye\\nshall\\nnot\\nenter\\ninto the kingdom of heaven.\\n4. Whosoever\\ntherefore\\nshall hum-\\nble\\nhimself\\nas\\nthis\\nlittle\\nchild,\\nthe\\nsame\\nis\\ngreatest\\nin\\nthe kingdom\\nof\\nheaven.\\n5. And\\nwhoso\\nshall\\nreceive\\none\\nsuch little child in my name receiveth\\nme.\\n6. But whoso\\nshall\\noffend\\none\\nof\\nthese\\nlittle ones which believe in me,\\nit were\\nbetter\\nfor him\\nthat\\na\\nmill-\\nstone were hanged about his neck, and\\nthat he were drowned in the depth of\\nthe sea.\\n7. Woe unto the world because\\nof\\noffences!\\nfor\\nit must\\nneeds\\nbe\\nthat\\noffences come; but woe\\nto\\nthat man\\nby whom the offence comethl\\n8. Wherefore\\nif\\nthy hand\\nor\\nthy\\nfoot offend\\nthee,\\ncut them\\noff, and\\ncast them from thee:\\nit\\nis better for\\nthee to enter into life halt or maimed,\\n240\\nCHRISTIANITY\\nrather than having two hands or two\\nfeet to be cast into everlasting\\nfire.\\n9. And\\nif\\nthine\\neye\\noffend\\nthee,\\npluck it out, and cast it from thee:\\nit\\nis\\nbetter\\nfor\\nthee\\nto\\nenter\\ninto\\nlife\\nwith one eye, rather than having two\\neyes to be cast into hell fire.\\n10. Take heed\\nthat ye\\ndespise not\\none of these little ones; for I say unto\\nyou. That in heaven\\ntheir angels do\\nalways behold the face of my Father\\nwhich is in heaven.\\n11. For the Son of man\\nis come to\\nsave that which was lost.\\n12. How think ye?\\nif a man have\\nan hundred\\nsheep, and one\\nof them\\nbe gone astray, doth he not leave the\\nninety and\\nnine, and\\ngoeth\\ninto\\nthe\\nmountains, and seeketh that which\\nis\\ngone astray?\\n13. And\\nif so be\\nthat he\\nfind\\nit,\\nverily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more\\nof that sheep, than of the ninety and\\nnine which went not astray.\\n14. Even so it is not the will of your\\nFather which is\\nin heaven,\\nthat one\\nof these little ones should perish.\\n15. Moreover\\nif\\nthy\\nbrother\\nshall\\ntrespass against thee, go and\\ntell him\\nhis fault between thee and him alone\\n:\\nif he shall hear thee, thou hast gained\\nthy brother.\\n16. But\\nif he\\nwill\\nnot\\nhear\\nthee,\\nthen take with thee one or two more,\\nthat\\nin\\nthe mouth\\nof\\ntwo\\nor\\nthree\\nwitnesses\\nevery word may\\nbe\\nestab-\\nlished.\\n17. And\\nif he\\nshall neglect to hear\\nthem,\\ntell\\nit unto the church:\\nbut\\nif\\nhe neglect to hear the church, let him\\nbe unto thee as an heathen man and\\na publican.\\n18. Verily I say unto you. Whatso-\\never ye\\nshall bind on\\nearth\\nshall be\\nbound\\nin heaven:\\nand whatsoever ye\\nshall loose on earth shall be loosed in\\nheaven,\\n19. Again\\nI\\nsay unto you, That\\nif\\ntwo\\nof you\\nshall\\nagree on\\nearth\\nas\\ntouching\\nany\\nthing\\nthat\\nthey\\nshall\\nask,\\nit\\nshall be done\\nfor them of my\\nFather which\\nis in heaven.\\n20. For\\nwhere\\ntwo\\nor\\nthree\\nare\\ngathered together\\nin my name,\\nthere\\nam I in the midst of them,\\n21. Then came\\nPeter\\nto him, and\\nsaid, Lord, how oft\\nshall my brother\\nsin\\nagainst me,\\nand\\nI\\nforgive him?\\ntill seven times?\\n22.\\nJesus saith unto him,\\nI say not\\nunto\\nthee.\\nUntil\\nseven\\ntimes:\\nbut,\\nUntil seventy times seven.\\nChapter\\n19\\n3. The\\nPharisees\\nalso\\ncame\\nunto\\nhim,\\ntempting him, and\\nsayiilg unto\\nhim,\\nIs\\nit\\nlawful\\nfor\\na man\\nto put\\naway his wife for every cause?\\n4. And he answered and said unto\\nthem,\\nHave\\nye\\nnot\\nread,\\nthat\\nhe\\nwhich made them\\nat\\nthe\\nbeginning\\nmade them male and female,\\n5. And\\nsaid. For this cause\\nshall a\\nman\\nleave\\nfather\\nand\\nmother,\\nand\\nshall\\ncleave\\nto\\nhis\\nwife:\\nand\\nthey\\ntwain shall be one flesh?\\n6. Wherefore\\nthey\\nare\\nno\\nmore\\ntwain, but one\\nflesh. What\\ntherefore\\nGod hath joined together, let not man\\nput asunder.\\n7. They\\nsay\\nunto\\nhim. Why\\ndid\\nMoses then command\\nto\\ngive a writ-\\ning\\nof\\ndivorcement,\\nand\\nto put her\\naway?\\n8. He\\nsaith unto them, Moses\\nbe-\\ncause\\nof the hardness of your hearts\\nsuffered you to put away your wives:\\nbut from the beginning\\nit was not\\nso.\\n9. And\\nI say unto you, Whosoever\\nshall put away his wife, except\\nit be\\nfor\\nfornication,\\nand\\nshall\\nmarry\\nanother,\\ncommitteth\\nadultery :\\nand\\nwhoso marrieth her which is put away\\ndoth commit adultery.\\n13. Then were\\nthere brought unto\\nhim little children, that he should put\\nhis\\nhands on\\nthem,\\nand\\npray:\\nand\\nthe\\ndisciples rebuked\\nthem.\\n14. But Jesus said. Suffer little chil-\\ndren, and\\nforbid them\\nnot,\\nto come\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n241\\nunto me:\\nfor of such\\nis the kingdom\\nof heaven.\\n15. And he laid his hands on them,\\nand departed thence.\\n16. And,\\nbehold,\\none\\ncame\\nand\\n•said\\nunto\\nhim,\\nGood\\nMaster,\\nwhat\\ngood thing shall I do, that I may have\\neternal\\nlife?\\n17. And\\nhe\\nsaid\\nunto\\nhim. Why\\ncallest thou me good?\\nthere\\nis none\\ngood but one, that is, God: but if thou\\nwilt\\nenter\\ninto\\nlife,\\nkeep\\nthe\\ncom-\\nmandments.\\n18. He\\nsaith\\nunto\\nhim.\\nWhich?\\nJesus said, Thou\\nshalt do no murder,\\nThou shalt not commit adultery. Thou\\nshalt not\\nsteal, Thou\\nshalt\\nnot bear\\nfalse witness,\\n19. Honour thy father and thy mo-\\nther: and, Thou shalt love thy neigh-\\nbour as thyself.\\n20. The young man saith unto him,\\nAll these things have\\nI kept from my\\nyouth up: what lack I yet?\\n21. Jesus\\nsaid\\nunto\\nhim.\\nIf\\nthou\\nwilt be perfect, go and\\nsell that thou\\nhast, and give\\nto the poor, and thou\\nshalt have\\ntreasure\\nin\\nheaven:\\nand\\ncome and follow me.\\n22. But when the young man heard\\nthat saying, he went away sorrowful;\\nfor he had great possessions.\\n23. Then\\nsaid\\nJesus unto\\nhis\\ndis-\\nciples, Verily\\nI say unto you, That a\\nrich man\\nshall hardly enter into the\\nkingdom of heaven.\\n24. And again I say unto you. It\\nis\\neasier for a camel to go through the\\neye\\nof a needle, than for a rich man\\nto enter into the kingdom of God.\\n25. When\\nhis\\ndisciples\\nheard\\nit,\\nthey were exceedingly amazed, saying.\\nWho then can be saved?\\n26. But Jesus beheld them, and said\\nunto them. With men\\nthis\\nis impos-\\nsible\\nbut with God all things are pos-\\nsible.\\nChapter 22\\n34.\\nBut\\nwhen\\nthe\\nPharisees\\nhad\\nheard that he had put the, Sadducees\\nto\\nsilence,\\nthey\\nwere\\ngathered\\nto-\\ngether.\\n35. Then one of them, which was a\\nlawyer, asked him a question, tempt-\\ning him, and saying,\\n36. Master, which is the great com-\\nmandment in the law?\\n37.\\nJesus\\nsaid\\nunto\\nhim.\\nThou\\nshalt love the Lord thy God with\\nail\\nthy heart, and with\\nall thy soul, and\\nwith\\nall thy mind.\\n38. This is the first and great com-\\nmandment.\\n39. And the second\\nis like unto\\nit.\\nThou\\nshalt\\nlove\\nthy\\nneighbor\\nas\\nthyself.\\n40. On\\nthese\\ntwo commandments\\nhang all the law and the prophets.\\nChapter 23\\n1. Then spake Jesus\\nto\\nthe multi-\\ntude, and\\nto\\nhis\\ndisciples,\\n2.\\nSaying,\\nThe\\nscribes\\nand\\nthe\\nPharisees\\nsit in Moses’\\nseat ;\\n3.\\nAll therefore whatsoever they bid\\nyou observe, that observe and do; but\\ndo not ye after their works:\\nfor they\\nsay, and do not.\\n4. For they bind heavy burdens and\\ngrievous to be borne, and lay them on\\nmen’s\\nshoulders; but they themselves\\nwill not move them with one of their\\nfingers.\\n5. But\\nall\\ntheir works they do\\nfor\\nto be seen of men:\\nthey make broad\\ntheir\\nphylacteries,\\nand\\nenlarge\\nthe\\nborders of their garments,\\n6.

And\\ncall\\nno man\\nyour\\nfather\\nupon\\nthe\\nearth:\\nfor\\none\\nis\\nyour\\nFather, which\\nis in heaven.\\n10. Neither be\\nye\\ncalled\\nmasters:\\n242\\nCHRISTIANITY\\nfor one\\nis your Master, even Christ.\\n11, But he\\nthat\\nis\\ngreatest among\\nyou shall be your servant.\\n12. And whosoever shall exalt him*-\\nself shall be abased; and he that shall\\nhumble himself shall be exalted.\\nChapter 25\\n14\\nFor\\nthe kingdom\\nof heaven\\nis\\nas a man travelling into a far country,\\nwho called\\nhis own servants, and de-\\nlivered unto them his goods.\\n15. And unto one he gave five tal-\\nents,\\nto another two, and\\nto another\\none ;\\nto\\nevery man\\naccording\\nto\\nhis\\nseveral\\nability; and\\nstraightway\\ntook\\nhis journey.\\n16. Then he that had received the\\nfive\\ntalents\\nwent\\nand\\ntraded\\nwith\\nthe same, and made them other\\nfive\\ntalents.\\n17. And\\nlikewise\\nhe\\nthat had\\nre-\\nceived two, he also gained other two.\\n18. But he\\nthat had\\nreceived one\\nwent and digged in the earth, and hid\\nhis\\nlord’s money.\\n19. After a long\\ntime\\nthe\\nlord\\nof\\nthose\\nservants cometh, and reckoneth\\nwith them.\\n20. And\\nso\\nhe\\nthat had\\nreceived\\nfive\\ntalents came and brought\\nother\\nfive\\ntalents,\\nsaying,\\nLord,\\nthou\\nde-\\nliveredst unto me five talents: behold,\\nI have gained beside them five talents\\n.•.more.\\n21.

Then\\nhe\\nwhich\\nhad\\nreceived\\nthe one talent came and said, Lord,\\nI\\nknew thee that thou art an hard man,\\nreaping\\nwhere\\nthou\\nhast\\nnot\\nsown,\\nand\\ngathering\\nwhere\\nthou\\nhast\\nnot\\nstrawed:\\n25. And\\nI\\nwas\\nafraid,\\nand\\nwent\\nand\\nhid\\nthy\\ntalent in\\nthe\\nearth:\\nlo,\\nthere thou hast that\\nis\\nthine.\\n26.

Thou oughtest therefore to have\\nput my money to the exchangers, and\\nthen at my coming I should have\\nre-\\nceived mine own with usury.\\n28. Take\\ntherefore the\\ntalent from\\nhim, and give\\nit unto him which hath\\nten talents.\\n29. For unto\\nevery one\\nthat hath\\nshall be given, and he shall have abun-\\ndance\\n:\\nbut from him\\nthat hath\\nnot\\nshall be taken away even that which\\nhe hath.\\n30.

And\\nwhen\\nJesus\\nwas\\npassed\\nover again by ship unto the other side,\\nmuch people gathered unto him: and\\nhe was nigh unto the sea.\\n22. And, behold, there cometh one\\nof the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus\\nby name; and When he saw him, he\\nfell at his feet,\\n23. And besought him greatly, say-\\ning, My\\nlittle\\ndaughter\\nlieth\\nat\\nthe\\npoint of death:\\nI pray thee, come and\\n244\\nCHRISTIANITY\\nlay\\nthy hands on\\nher,\\nthat\\nshe may\\nbe healed; and she\\nshall\\nlive.\\n24.

And had\\nsuffered many things\\nof many\\nphysicians,\\nand\\nhad\\nspent\\nall\\nthat\\nshe\\nhad,\\nand\\nwas\\nnothing\\nbettered, but rather grew worse,\\n27. When she had heard of Jesus,\\ncame in the press behind, and touched\\nhis garment.\\n28. For\\nshe\\nsaid,\\nIf\\nI may touch\\nbut his\\nclothes,\\nI shall be whole.\\n29. And straightway the fountain of\\nher blood was dried up ; and she felt\\nin\\nher body\\nthat\\nshe was healed\\nof\\nthat plague.\\n30. And\\nJesus, immediately know-\\ning\\nin\\nhimself\\nthat\\nvirtue had gone\\nout of him, turned him about in the\\npress,\\nand\\nsaid. Who\\ntouched my\\nclothes?\\n31. And his disciples said unto him.\\nThou\\nseest\\nthe\\nmultitude\\nthronging\\nfcee, and\\nsayest\\nthou, Who touched\\nme?\\n32. And he looked round about to\\nsee her that had done\\nthis\\nthing.\\n33. But\\nthe\\nwoman\\nfearing\\nand\\ntrembling, knowing what was done in\\nher, came and\\nfell down before him,\\nand told him all the truth.\\n34.

While he yet spake, there came\\nfrom\\nthe\\nruler\\nof\\nthe\\nsynagogue’s\\nhouse certain which said. Thy daugh-\\nter\\nis dead: why\\ntroublest thou\\nthe\\nMaster any further?\\n36. As soon as Jesus heard the word\\nthat was\\nspoken,\\nhe\\nsaith\\nunto\\nthe\\nruler of the synagogue. Be not afraid,\\nonly believe.\\n37. And he suffered no man to fol-\\nlow him, save Peter, and James, and\\nJohn the brother of James.\\n38.

And when he came to\\nhis\\ndis-\\nciples, he saw a great multitude about\\nthem,\\nand\\nthe\\nscribes\\nquestioning\\nwith them.\\n15. And straightway all the people,\\nwhen\\nthey beheld\\nhim, were\\ngreatly\\namazed, and running\\nto him saluted\\nhim.\\n16. And he asked the scribes. What\\nquestion ye with them?\\n17. And one of the multitude an-\\nswered\\nand\\nsaid,\\nMaster,\\nI\\nhave\\nbrought unto thee my son, which hath\\na dumb\\nspirit;\\n18. And wheresoever he taketh him,\\nhe teareth him: and he foameth, and\\ngnasheth with\\nhis\\nteeth,\\nand\\npineth\\naway:\\nand\\nI\\nspake\\nto\\nthy\\ndisciples\\nthat\\nthey\\nshould\\ncast him\\nout; and\\nthey could not.\\n19.

And he asked\\nhis\\nfather, How\\nlong\\nis\\nit ago\\nsince\\nthis came\\nunto\\nhim? And he said, Of a child.\\n22. And\\nofttimes\\nit hath\\ncast him\\ninto the\\nfire, and\\ninto the waters, to\\ndestroy him: but if thou canst do any\\nthing,\\nhave\\ncompassion\\non\\nus,\\nand\\nhelp us.\\n23.

And\\nstraightway the\\nfather\\nof\\nthe\\nchild\\ncried\\nout,\\nand\\nsaid\\nwith\\ntears, Lord,\\nI believe; help thou mine\\nunbelief.\\n25. When Jesus saw that the people\\ncame\\nrunning\\ntogether,\\nhe\\nrebuked\\nthe foul spirit, saying unto him.

And\\nthe\\nspirit\\ncried, and\\nrent\\nhim\\nsore, and came out\\nof him: and\\nhe was\\nas\\none\\ndead; insomuch\\nthat\\nmany said. He\\nis dead.\\n27. But Jesus took him by the hand,\\nand lifted him up ; and he arose.\\n28. And when\\nhe\\nwas come\\ninto\\nthe house, his disciples asked him pri-\\nvately, Why\\ncould\\nnot we\\ncast him\\nout?\\n29. And\\nhe\\nsaid unto them.\\nThis\\nkind can come forth by nothing, but\\nby prayer and fasting.\\nChapter 10\\n2. And the Pharisees came to him,\\nand asked him. Is\\nit lawful for a man\\nto put away his wife? tempting him.\\n3. And he answered and\\nsaid unto\\nthem, What did Moses command you?\\n4. And they said, Moses suffered to\\nwrite a bill of divorcement, and to put\\nher away.\\n\\\\\\\\\\n5. And\\nJesus\\nanswered\\nand\\nsaid\\nunto them, For the hardness of your\\nheart he wrote you this precept.\\n6. But from\\nthe beginning\\nof\\nthe\\ncreation God made\\nthem male\\nandl\\nfemale.\\n7. For this cause shall a man leave\\nhis father and mother, and cleave to\\nhis wife,\\n8. And\\nthey\\ntwain\\nshall\\nbe\\none\\nflesh:\\nso then they are no more twain,\\nbut one flesh.\\n9. What therefore God hath joined\\ntogether,\\nlet not man put asunder.\\n10. And\\nin\\nthe house\\nhis\\ndisciples\\nasked him again\\nof the same matter.\\n11. And he saith unto them, Who-\\nsoever\\nshall put away\\nhis\\nwife, and\\nmarry\\nanother,\\ncommitteth\\nadultery\\nagainst her.\\n12. And if a woman shall put away\\nher husband, and be married\\nto an-\\nother, she committeth adultery.\\n13. And\\nthey brought young\\nchil-\\ndren\\nto\\nhim,\\nthat\\nhe\\nshould\\ntouch\\nthem: and his disciples rebuked those\\nthat brought them.\\n14. But when Jesus saw\\nit, he was\\nmuch displeased, and said unto them.\\nSuffer the little children to come unto\\nme, and forbid them not:\\nfor of such\\nis the kingdom of God.\\n15.\\nVerily I say unto you, Whoso-\\never\\nshall\\nnot\\nreceive\\nthe\\nkingdom\\nof God as a\\nlittle child, he shall not\\nenter therein.\\n16. And\\nhe\\ntook them up\\nin\\nhis\\narms, put his hands upon them, and\\nblessed them.\\n17. And when he was gone\\nforth\\ninto the way, there came one running,\\nand kneeled\\nto him, and asked him.\\nGood Master, what shall\\nI do that\\nI\\nmay inherit eternal life?\\n18. And Jesus said unto him. Why\\ncallest thou me good?\\nthere\\nis none\\ngood but one, that\\nis, God.\\n19. Thou\\nknowest\\nthe\\ncommand-\\nments, Do\\nnot commit\\nadultery. Do\\nnot\\nkill.

And he answered and said unto\\nhim, Master, all these have I observed\\nfrom my youth.\\n21. Then\\nJesus\\nbeholding\\nhim\\nloved\\nhim, and\\nsaid unto him, One\\nthing thou\\nlackest:\\ngo\\nthy way,\\nsell\\nwhatsoever thou hast, and give to the\\npoor,\\nand\\nthou\\nshalt\\nhave\\ntreasure\\nin\\nheaven:\\nand\\ncome,\\ntake up\\nthe\\ncross, and follow me.\\n22. And he was sad at that saying,\\nand went away\\ngrieved:\\nfor he had\\ngreat possessions.\\n23. And Jesus looked round about,\\nand\\nsaith\\nunto\\nhis\\ndisciples, How\\nhardly\\nshall\\nthey\\nthat\\nhave\\nriches\\nenter into the kingdom of God!\\n24. And\\nthe\\ndisciples were\\naston-\\nished at his words. But Jesus answer-\\neth again, and saith unto them, Chil-\\ndren, how\\nhard\\nis\\nit\\nfor them\\nthat\\ntrust in riches to enter into the king-,\\ndom of God!\\n25.\\nIt\\nis\\neasier\\nfor a camel\\nto go\\nthrough the eye of a needle, than for\\na rich man to enter into the kingdom\\nof God.\\n26. And\\nthey were\\nastonished out\\nof measure, saying among themselves,\\nWho then can be saved?\\n27. And\\nJesus\\nlooking upon them\\nsaith. With men\\nit\\nis impossible, but\\nnot with God : for with God all things\\nare possible.\\nChapter\\n11\\n22. And Jesus answering saith unto\\nthem. Have faith in God.\\n23. For verily I say unto you. That\\nwhosoever\\nshall\\nsay unto\\nthis moun-\\ntain, Be thou removed, and be thou\\ncast into the sea; and shall not doubt\\nin\\nhis\\nheart,\\nbut\\nshall\\nbelieve\\nthat\\nthose things which he saith shall come\\nto pass; he\\nshall have whatsoever he\\nsaith.\\n24. Therefore I say unto you, What\\nthings soever ye desire, v/hen ye pray.\\nbelieve\\nthat ye receive them, and ye\\nshall have them.\\n25.

And\\none\\nof\\nthe\\nscribes\\ncame,\\nand having heard thera reasoning\\nto-\\ngether, and perceiving that he had an-\\nswered them\\nwell, asked him. Which\\nis the\\nfirst commandment of all?\\n29. And\\nJesus answered him, The\\nfirst\\nof\\nall\\nthe\\ncommandments\\nis,\\nHear, O\\nIsrael;\\nthe\\nLord\\nour God\\nis one Lord:\\n30. And\\nthou\\nshalt\\nlove\\nthe Lord\\nthy God with\\nall thy heart, and with\\nall thy\\nsoul, and with\\nall\\nthy mind,\\nand with\\nall thy strength:\\nthis\\nis the\\nfirst commandment.\\n31.

And\\nthe\\nscribe\\nsaid unto him.\\nWell,\\nMaster,\\nthou\\nhast\\nsaid\\nthe\\ntruth:\\nfor there is one God; and there\\nis none other but he:\\n33. And\\nto\\nlove him with\\nall the\\nheart, and with all the understanding,\\nand with all the soul, and with all the\\nstrength, and\\nto\\nlove\\nhis\\nneighbour\\nas\\nhimself,\\nis\\nmore\\nthan\\nall\\nwhole\\nburnt offerings and sacrifices.\\n34. And when\\nJesus\\nsaw\\nthat he\\nanswered discreetly, he said unto him.\\nThou\\nart not\\nfar from the kingdom\\nof God. And no man after that durst\\nask him any question.\\n35. And\\nJesus answered and\\nsaid,\\nwhile he taught in\\nthe temple. How\\nsay the\\nscribes that Christ\\nis the son\\nof David?\\n36. For David himself said by the\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n247\\nHoly\\nGhost, The\\nLord\\nsaid\\nto my\\nLord/ Sit thou on my right hand,\\ntill\\nI make\\n\\' thine\\nenemies\\nthy\\nfootstool.\\n37 .

And he\\nsaid unto them in his\\ndoctrine, Beware of the scribes, which\\nlove\\nto go in long clothing, and love\\nsalutations\\nin\\nthe\\nmarketplaces,\\n39. And the chief seats in the syna-\\ngogues, and\\nthe uppermost rooms at\\nfeasts:\\n40. Which devour widows*\\nhouses,\\nand for a pretence make long prayers:\\nthese shall receive greater damnation.\\n41. And Jesus\\nsat over against the\\ntreasury, and beheld how the people\\ncast money\\ninto\\nthe\\ntreasury:\\nand\\nmany that were rich cast in much.\\n42. And there came a certain poor\\nwidow, and she threw in two\\nmites,\\nwhich make a farthing.\\n43. And\\nhe\\ncalled\\nunto\\nhim\\nhis\\ndisciples, and saith unto them, Verily\\nI say unto you. That this poor widow\\nhath cast more in, than all they which\\nhave cast into the treasury:\\n44. For all they did cast in of their\\nabundance; but she\\nof her want did\\ncast in\\nall that she had, even\\nall her\\nliving.\\nChapter 14\\n17.

And they began\\nto be sorrow-\\nful, and to say unto him one by one,\\nIs\\nit I? and another said. Is\\nit I?\\n20. And he answered and said unto\\nthem,\\nIt\\nis\\none\\nof\\nthe\\ntwelve, that\\ndippeth with me in the dish.\\n21.

And he took the cup, and when\\nhe had\\ngiven\\nthanks, he\\ngave\\nit\\nto\\nthem; and they all drank of\\nit.\\n24. And he said unto them, This\\nis\\nmy blood of the new testament, which\\nis shed for many.\\n25.\\nVerily\\nI\\nsay\\nunto\\nyou,\\nI\\nwill\\ndrink no more of the fruit of the vine,\\nuntil that day that\\nI drink\\nit new in\\nthe kingdom of God.\\n26. And when\\nthey had\\nsung\\nan\\nhymn, they went out into\\nthe mount\\nof Olives,\\n32. And they came to a place which\\nwas named Gethsemane : and he saith\\nto\\nhis\\ndisciples,\\nSit ye\\nhere, while\\nI\\nshall pray.\\n33. And he taketh with him Peter\\nand James and\\nJohn, and began\\nto\\nb?e sore amazed, and to be very heavy;\\n34. And saith unto them, My soul\\nis\\nexceeding\\nsorrowful\\nunto\\ndeath;\\ntarry ye here, and watch.\\n35. And he went forward a\\nlittle,\\nand\\nfell\\non\\nthe\\nground, and prayed\\nthat,\\nif\\nit\\nwere\\npossible,\\nthe\\nhour\\nmight pass from him.\\n36.

What\\nshall\\nI\\ndo,\\nbecause\\nI\\nhave no room\\nwhere\\nto bestow my\\nfruits?\\n18. And he\\nsaid, This\\nwill\\nI do:\\nI\\nwill\\npull down my barns, and\\nbuild\\ngreater; and\\nthere\\nwill\\nI bestow\\nall\\nmy\\nfruits and my goods.\\n19. And\\nI will say to my soul.

Thou\\n,\\nfool,\\nthis\\nnight\\nthy\\nsoul\\nshall be\\nre-\\nquired of thee: then whose shall those\\nthings\\nbe, which thou hast provided?\\n21. So is he that layeth up treasure\\nfor\\nhimself, and\\nis\\nnot\\nrich\\ntoward\\nGod.\\n22. And he said unto\\nhis\\ndisciples,\\nTherefore\\nI\\nsay\\nunto\\nyou. Take\\nno\\nthought\\nfor your\\nlife, what ye\\nshall\\ncat;\\nneither\\nfor\\nthe\\nbody,\\nwhat\\nye\\nshall put on.\\n23.

And seek not ye what ye shall\\neat, or what\\nye\\nshall\\ndrink,\\nneither\\nbe ye of doubtful mind.\\n30.\\nFor\\nall these things do the na-\\ntions\\nof\\nthe\\nworld\\nseek\\nafter:\\nand\\nyour\\nFather\\nknoweth\\nthat\\nye\\nhave\\nneed of these things.\\n31.

For\\nwhere\\nyour\\ntreasure\\nis,\\nthere will your heart be also.\\n35. Let your loins be girded about,\\nand your lights burning;\\n36. And ye yourselves like unto men\\nthat wait for their lord, when he will\\nreturn from\\nthe wedding;\\nthat when\\nhe cometh and\\nknocketh,\\nthey may\\nopen unto him immediately.\\n37.\\nBlessed\\nare\\nthose\\nservants,\\nwhom the lord when he cometh shall\\nfind watching:\\nverily I\\nsay unto you,\\nthat he\\nshall gird\\nhimself, and make\\nthem\\nto\\nsit down\\nto meat, and\\nwill\\nCome forth and\\nserve them.\\n252\\nCHRISTIANITY\\n38. And if he shall come in the sec-\\nond\\nwatch,\\nor\\ncome\\nin\\nthe\\nthird\\nwatch, and\\nfind them\\nso, blessed are\\nthose servants.\\n39. And\\nthis\\nknow,\\nthat\\nif\\nthe\\ngoodman\\nof\\nthe\\nhouse\\nhad\\nknown\\nwhat hour the\\nthief would come, he\\nwould\\nhave\\nwatched,\\nand\\nnot have\\nsuffered\\nhis\\nhouse\\nto\\nbe\\nbroken\\nthrough.\\n40. Be ye therefore ready also:\\nfor\\nthe Son\\nof man cometh\\nat an hour\\nwhen ye think not\\nChapter\\n13\\n18. Then\\nsaid\\nhe,\\nUnto\\nwhat\\nis\\nthe kingdom of God like?* and where-\\nunto shall I resemble it?\\n19.\\nIt\\nis\\nlike\\na\\ngrain\\nof mustard\\nseed, which a man took, and cast into\\nhis garden; and it grew, and waxed a\\ngreat\\ntree; and\\nthe\\nfowls\\nof\\nthe\\nair\\nlodged in the branches of\\nit.\\n20. And again he\\nsaid, Whereunto\\nshall I liken the kingdom of God?\\n21.\\nIt\\nis\\nlike\\nleaven,\\nwhich\\na\\nwoman took and hid\\nin\\nthree meas-\\nures\\nof\\nmeal,\\ntill\\nthe\\nwhole\\nwas\\nleavened.\\n22. And he went through the cities\\nand\\nvillages,\\nteaching, and\\njourney-\\ning toward Jerusalem.\\n23. Then said one unto him, Lord,\\nare there few that be saved? And he\\nsaid unto them,\\n24.\\nStrive\\nto enter in at the\\nstrait\\ngate:\\nfor many,\\nI say unto you, will\\nseek to enter in, and shall not be able.\\n25. When once\\nthe master\\nof\\nthe\\nhouse\\nis\\nrisen\\nup, and hath\\nshut\\nto\\nthe door, and ye begin to stand with-\\nout, and to knock at the door saying.\\nLord,\\nLord,\\nopen\\nunto\\nus; and\\nhe\\nshall answer and say unto you, I know\\nyou not whence ye are:\\n26. Then shall ye begin to say. We\\nhave eaten and drunk in thy presence,\\nand thou hast taught in our streets.\\n27. But he\\nshall\\nsay,\\nI\\ntell you, I\\nknow you not whence ye\\nare; depart\\nfrom me,\\nall ye workers of iniquity.\\n28.

And\\nthey\\nshall come from\\nthe\\neast, and from the west, and from the\\nnorth, and from the\\nsouth, and\\nshall\\nsit down in the kingdom of God.\\n30. And,\\nbehold,\\nthere\\nare\\nlast\\nwhich shall be first, and there are first\\nwhich shall be\\nlast.\\n31. The same day there came\\ncer-\\ntain of the Pharisees, saying unto him,\\nGet thee\\nout, and depart hence :\\nfor\\nHerod\\nwill\\nkill thee.\\n32. And he said unto them. Go ye,\\nand\\ntell that\\nfox. Behold,\\nI\\ncast out\\ndevils, and\\nI do cures to day and to\\nmorrow, and the third day I shall be\\nperfected.\\n33. Nevertheless\\nI\\nmust\\nwalk\\nto\\nday, and to morrow, and the day fol-\\nlowing: for it cannot be that a prophet\\nperish out of Jerusalem.\\n34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which\\nkillest the prophets, and stonest them\\nthat\\nare\\nsent unto\\nthee; how\\noften\\nwould\\nI have\\ngathered\\nthy\\nchildren\\ntogether,\\nas\\na hen\\ndoth\\ngather\\nher\\nbrood under her wings, and ye would\\nnotl\\n35.

And they held\\ntheir peace. And\\nhe took him, and healed him, and\\nlet\\nhim go;\\n5.

And they could not answer him\\nagain to these things.\\n7. And he put forth\\na parable\\nto\\nthose\\nwhich\\nwere\\nbidden, when\\nhe\\nmarked how they chose out the chief\\nrooms ; saying unto them,\\n8. When\\nthou\\nart bidden\\nof any\\nman to a wedding, sit not down in the\\nhighest\\nroom;\\nlest\\na\\nmore\\nhonour-\\nable man than thou be bidden of him\\n;\\n9. And he that bade thee and him\\ncome and say to thee, Give this man\\nplace; and thou begin with shame to\\ntake the lowest room.\\n10. But when thou\\nart bidden, go\\nand sit down in the lowest room; that\\nwhen he\\nthat bade\\nthee cometh, he\\nmay\\nsay\\nunto\\nthee,\\nFriend,\\ngo up\\nhigher:\\nthen shalt thou have worship\\nin\\nthe\\npresence\\nof them\\nthat\\nsit at\\nmeat with thee.\\n11. For\\nwhosoever,\\nexalteth\\nhim-\\nself\\nshall\\nbe\\nabased;\\nand\\nhe\\nthat\\nhumbleth himself shall be exalted.\\n12. Then said he\\nalso to him that\\nbade him. When thou makest a\\ndin-\\nner or a supper,\\ncall not thy\\nfriends,\\nnor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen,\\nnor\\nthy\\nrich\\nneighbours ;\\nlest\\nthey\\nalso bid thee again, and a recompence\\nbe made thee,\\n13. But when thou makest a feast,\\ncall the poor, the maimed, the lame,\\nthe blind:\\n14. And thou shalt be blessed; for\\nthey\\ncannot\\nrecompense\\nthee:\\nfor\\nthou\\nshalt\\nbe\\nrecompensed\\nat\\nthe\\nresurrection of the just.\\nChapter\\n15\\n3. And he spake\\nthis parable unto\\nthem,\\nsaying,\\n4. What man\\nof\\nyou,\\nhaving an\\nhundred sheep,\\nif he lose one of them,\\ndoth not leave the ninety and nine in\\nthe\\nwilderness,\\nand\\ngo\\nafter\\nthat\\nwhich\\nis lost, until he find it?\\n5. And when he hath found\\nit, he\\nlayeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.\\n6. And when he cometh home, he\\ncalleth together his friends and neigh-\\nbours, saying unto them. Rejoice with\\nme; for I have found my sheep which\\nwas\\nlost.\\n7.\\nI say unto you, that likewise joy\\nshall be in heaven over one sinner that\\nrepenteth, more than over ninety and\\nnine\\njust persons, which need no\\nre-\\npentance.\\nChapter\\n17\\n3. Take heed to yourselves:\\nIf thy\\nbrother\\ntrespass\\nagainst\\nthee, rebuke\\nhim; and if he repent, forgive him.\\n4. And\\nif he\\ntrespass\\nagainst\\nthee\\nseven times in a day, and seven times\\nin a day turn again to thee, saying, I\\nrepent; thou shalt forgive him.\\n5. And\\nthe\\napostles\\nsaid unto the\\nLord, Increase our faith.\\n6. And\\nthe\\nLord\\nsaid.\\nIf ye had\\nfaith\\nas a\\ngrain of mustard\\nseed, ye\\nmight say unto this sycamine tree, Be\\nthou plucked up by the\\nroot, and be\\nthou planted in the sea; and it should\\nobey you.\\n7. But which of you, having a serv-\\nant plowing or feeding cattle, will say\\nunto him by and by, when he is come\\nfrom\\nthe\\nfield, Go and\\nsit down\\nto\\nmeat?\\n8. And will not rather say unto him,\\nMake ready wherewith I may sup, and\\ngird thyself, and serve me,\\ntill\\nI have\\neaten\\nand\\ndrunken ;\\nand\\nafterward\\nthou shalt eat and drink?\\n9. Doth he thank\\nthat servant be-\\ncause\\nhe\\ndid\\nthe\\nthings\\nthat\\nwere\\ncommanded him? I trow not.\\n10.\\nSo\\nlikewise\\nye, when\\nye\\nshall\\nhave done\\nall those things which are\\ncommanded you, say, We are unprofit-\\nable\\nservants\\n:\\nwe\\nhave\\ndone\\nthat\\nwhich was our duty to do,\\n11.\\n\\' And\\nit came to pass, as he went\\nto Jerusalem,\\nthat he passed through\\nthe midst of Samaria and Galilee.\\n254\\nCHRISTIANITY\\n12. And as he entered into a certain\\nvillage,\\nthere met him\\nten men\\nthat\\nwere lepers, which stood afar off\\n13. And they lifted up their voices,\\nand\\nsaid,\\nJesus, Master,\\nhave mercy\\non us.\\n14. And when he saw them, he said\\nunto them, Go shew yourselves unto\\nthe priests. And\\nit came to pass, that,\\nas they went, they were cleansed.\\n15. And. one of them, when he saw\\nthat he was healed, turned back, and\\nwith a loud voice glorified God,\\n16. And fell down on his face at his\\nfeet, giving him thanks:\\nand he was\\na Samaritan.\\n17. And Jesus answering said. Were\\nthere\\nnot\\nten\\ncleansed?\\nBut\\nwhere\\nare the nine?\\n18. There\\nare\\nnot found\\nthat\\nre-\\nturned to give glory to God, save this\\nstranger.\\n19. And\\nhe\\nsaid unto him.\\nArise,\\ngo thy way: thy faith hath made thee\\nwhole.\\n20. And when\\nhe\\nwas demanded\\nof\\nthe\\nPharisees, when\\nthe kingdom\\nof\\nGod\\nshould\\ncome,\\nhe\\nanswered\\nthem and\\nsaid. The kingdom of God\\ncometh not with observation\\n21. Neither shall they say, Lo here!\\nor, lo there!\\nfor, behold, the kingdom\\nof God\\nis within you.\\nChapter\\n18\\n9. And he spake\\nthis parable unto\\ncertain\\nwhich\\ntrusted\\nin\\nthemselves\\nthat they were righteous, and despised\\nothers\\n10. Two men went up into the tem-\\nple\\nto pray; the one a Pharisee, and\\nthe other a publican.\\n11. The Pharisee stood and prayed\\nthus with himself, God, I thank thee,\\nthat\\nI am not as other men\\nare,\\nex-\\ntortioners,\\nunjust,\\nadulterers, or even\\nas\\nthis publican.\\n12.\\nI fast twice in the week, I give\\ntithes of all that I possess.\\n13. And the publican, standing afar\\noff, would not\\nlift up so much as his\\neyes unto heaven, but smote upon his\\nbreast, saying, God be merciful to me\\na sinner.\\n14.\\nI\\ntell you, this man went down\\nto\\nhis house\\njustified rather than the\\nother:\\nfor\\nevery\\none\\nthat\\nexalteth\\nhimself\\nshall be abased; and he\\nthat\\nhumbleth himself shall be exalted.\\n15. And\\nthey\\nbrought\\nunto\\nhim\\nalso\\ninfants,\\nthat\\nhe\\nwould\\ntouch\\nthem:\\nbut when\\nhis\\ndisciples saw\\nit,\\nthey rebuked them.\\n16. But Jesus called them unto him,\\nand\\' said. Suffer little children to come\\nunto me, and forbid them not:\\nfor of\\nsuch is the kingdom of God.\\n17. Verily\\nI say unto you, Whoso-\\never shall not receive the kingdom of\\nGod as a\\nlittle child shall in no wise\\nenter therein.\\n18. And a certain ruler asked him,\\nsaying. Good Master, what shall\\nI do\\nto inherit eternal life ?\\n19. And Jesus said unto him. Why\\ncallest thou me good? none\\nis good,\\nsave one, that is, God.\\n20. Thou\\nknowest\\nthe\\ncommand-\\nments, Do\\nnot commit\\nadultery. Do\\nnot kill, Do not steal. Do not bear false\\nwitness. Honour\\nthy\\nfather and\\nthy\\nmother.\\n21. And he\\nsaid. All\\nthese have\\nI\\nkept from my youth up.\\n22. Now when\\nJesus\\nheard\\nthese\\nthings, he said unto him. Yet lackest\\nthou one thing:\\nsell all that thou hast,\\nand distribute unto the poor, and thou\\nshalt\\nhave\\ntreasure\\nin\\nheaven:\\nand\\ncome, follow me.\\n23. And when\\nhe\\nheard\\nthis,\\nhe\\nwas very sorrowful:\\nfor he was very\\nrich.\\n24. And when\\nJesus\\nsaw\\nthat\\nhe\\nwas\\nvery\\nsorrowful,\\nhe\\nsaid.\\nHow\\nhardly\\nshall\\nthey\\nthat\\nhave\\nriches\\nenter into the kingdom of God!\\n25. For it is easier for a camel to go\\nthrough a needle’s eye, than for a rich\\nman\\nto\\nenter\\ninto\\nthe\\nkingdom\\nof\\nGod.\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n255\\n26. And\\nthey\\nthat\\nheard\\nit\\nsaid,\\nWho then can be saved?\\n27. And he said, The things which\\nare impossible with men are possible\\nwith God.\\n28. Then Peter\\nsaid,\\nLo, we have\\nleft\\nall, and followed thee.\\n29. And he said unto them, Verily\\nI say unto you. There is no man that\\nhath\\nleft house,\\nor parents, or breth-\\nren, or wife, or children, for the king-\\ndom of God’s sake,\\n30. Who shall not receive manifold\\nmore in this present time, and\\nin the\\nworld to come life everlasting.\\nThe Gospel According\\nto\\nSt, John\\nThis\\ngospel\\nhas\\nbeen\\ncalled\\n‘\"the\\nmost influential book in\\nall literature/^\\nScholars are agreed that\\nit was written\\nby\\nSt. John, the\\napostle of Jesus.\\nIts\\ndate\\ncannot\\nbe\\nset\\naccurately,\\nhut\\nis\\nprobably between 8o and p5 a.d., and\\nis\\nsaid\\nto\\nhave\\nbeen\\nwritten\\nat\\nthe\\nrequest of John^s fellow\\ndisciples and\\nthe elders at Ephesus,\\nJohn was\\ninterested\\nin\\nwriting\\nfor\\nadult\\nChristians to confirm their faith\\nthat\\nJesus\\nis the\\nChrist,\\nthe Son of\\nGod.” Being a philosopher, the author\\nassociates Jesus with Greek philosophy\\nthrough\\nthe\\ndoctrine of the “Logos.”\\nThus he omits much that\\nis found in\\nthe other gospels, but adds many\\ndis-\\ncourses\\nof\\nJesus\\nand\\ndiscussions\\nof\\nphilosophic\\npoints. Further, the Jesus\\nof\\nthis gospel\\nis a mystical individual\\nof deep spiritual understanding.\\nThis\\nis\\nthe\\nmost\\noriginal\\nof\\nthe\\ngospels, John speaking of things which\\nhe had seen and known, adding\\ninci-\\ndents\\nwith which\\nother\\nwriters were\\nnot familiar.\\nChapter 5\\n17. But\\nJesus answered them. My\\nFather worketh hitherto, and\\nI work.\\n18. Therefore the Jews sought the\\nmore\\nto\\nkill him, because he not only\\nhad broken the sabbath, but said also\\nthat God was his Father, making him-\\nself equal with God.\\n19. Then answered\\nJesus and\\nsaid\\nunto them,\\nVerily,\\nverily,\\nI say unto\\nyou. The Son can do nothing of him-\\nself, but what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, these\\nalso doeth the Son likewise.\\n20. For the Father loveth the Son,\\nand sheweth him all things that him-\\nself\\ndoeth:\\nand\\nhe\\nwill\\nshew\\nhim\\ngreater works than these, that ye may\\nmarvel.\\n21. For as the Father raiseth up the\\ndead, and\\nquickeneth\\nthem; even\\nso\\nthe Son quickeneth whom he will.\\n22. For the Father judgeth no man,\\nbut hath committed all judgment unto\\nthe Son:\\n23. That all men should honour the\\nSon, even as they honour the Father.\\nHe\\nthat honoureth not the Son hon-\\noureth not the Father which hath sent\\nhim,\\n24. Verily,\\nverily,\\nI say unto\\nyou,\\nHe\\nthat heareth my\\nword,\\nand\\nbe-\\nlieveth\\non\\nhim\\nthat\\nsent\\nme,\\nhath\\neverlasting\\nlife, and\\nshall\\nnot come\\ninto condemnation; but is passed from\\ndeath unto\\nlife.\\n25. Verily,\\nverily,\\nI\\nsay unto\\nyou,\\nThe hour is coming, and now is, when\\nthe dead\\nshall hear the\\nvoice of the\\nSon of God: and they that hear shall\\nlive.\\n26. For\\nas\\nthe\\nFather hath\\nlife in\\nhimself; so hath he given to the Son\\nto have life in himself ;\\n27. And hath\\ngiven him\\nauthority\\nto execute judgment\\nalso, because he\\nis the Son\\nof man.\\n28. Marvel not at this:\\nfor the hour\\nis coming, in the which all that are in\\nthe graves shall hear his voice,\\n29. And shall come forth; they that\\nhave done good, unto the resurrection\\nof\\nlife; and they that have done\\nevil,\\nunto the resurrection of damnation.\\n30.\\nI can of mine own self do noth-\\n256\\nCHRISTIANITY\\ning;\\nas I hear, I judge: and my judg-\\nment\\nis just; because\\nI seek not mine\\nown\\nwill, but\\nthe\\nwill\\nof the Father\\nwhich hath sent me.\\n31.\\nIf\\nI bear witness of myself, my\\nwitness\\nis not true.\\n32. There\\nis\\nandther\\nthat beareth\\nwitness\\nof me; and\\nI know\\nthat the\\nwitness which he witnesseth\\nof me\\nis\\ntrue.\\n33\\nYe sent unto John, and he bare\\nwitness unto\\nthe\\ntruth.\\n34. But I receive not testimony from\\nman :\\nbut these\\nthings\\nI\\nsay, that ye\\nmight be saved.\\n35. He was a burning and a\\nshin-\\ning\\nlight:\\nand ye were\\nwilling for a\\nseason to rejoice in His light.\\n36. But I have greater witness than\\nthat of John:\\nfor the works which the\\nFather hath\\ngiven me\\nto\\nfinish,\\nthe\\nsame works that I do, bear witness of\\nme, that the Father hath sent me.\\n37. And the Father himself, which\\nhath\\nsent me, hath borne\\nwitness of\\nme. Ye have\\nneither heard\\nhis voice\\nat any time, nor seen his shape.\\n38. And ye have not his word abid-\\ning\\nin you:\\nfor whom he hath\\nsent,\\nhim ye believe\\nnot.\\n39.

How can ye believe, which re-\\nceive honour one of another, and seek\\nnot the honour that cometh from God\\nonly?\\n45. Do not think that I will accuse\\nyou\\nto the Father:\\nthere\\nis one that\\naccuseth\\nyou,\\neven\\nMoses,\\nin whom\\nye\\ntrust.\\n46.

Now\\nabout\\nthe\\nmidst\\nof\\nthe\\nfeast Jesus went up\\ninto\\nthe\\ntemple,\\nand taught\\n15. And\\nthe\\nJews\\nmarvelled,\\nsay-\\ning, How knoweth\\nthis man\\nletters,\\nhaving never learned?\\n16. Jesus answered them, and said,\\nMy doctrine\\nis not mine, but his that\\nsent me.\\n17.\\nIf any man will do his will, he\\nshall know of the doctrine, whether it\\nbe of God, or whether I speak of my-\\nself.\\n18. He\\nthat\\nspeaketh\\nof\\nhimself\\nseeketh\\nhis own\\nglory:\\nbut he\\nthat\\nseeketh\\nhis\\nglory\\nthat\\nsent him,\\nthe\\nsame\\nis\\ntrue, and no unrighteousness\\nis in him.\\n19. Did\\nnot\\nMoses\\ngive\\nyou\\nthe\\nlaw, and yet none of you keepeth tne\\nlaw? Why go ye about to\\nkill me?\\n20. The people answered and said,\\nThou hast a devil: who goeth about\\nto\\nkill thee?\\n21. Jesus answered and\\nsaid\\nunto\\nthem,\\nI have done one work, and ye\\nall marvel.\\n22. Moses therefore gave unto you\\ncircumcision;\\n(not\\nbecause\\nit\\nis\\nof\\nMoses,\\nbut\\nof\\nthe\\nfathers;)\\nand\\nye\\non the sabbath day circumcise a man.\\n23.\\nIf a man on the sabbath day re-\\nceive\\ncircumcision,\\nthat\\nthe\\nlaw\\nof\\nMoses should\\nnot be broken; are ye\\nangry at me, because\\nI have made a\\nman every whit whole on the sabbath\\nday?\\n24.

Then said some of them of Jeru-\\nsalem, Is not this he, whom they seek\\nto Mil?\\n26.\\nBut, lo, he speaketh boldly, and\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n257\\nthey\\nsay\\nnothing unto\\nhim.

But I know him:\\nfor I am from\\nhim, and he hath sent me.\\n30. Then they sought to take him:\\nbut no man laid hands on him, because\\nhis hour was not yet come.\\n31.

For David speaketh concerning\\nhim,\\nI foresaw the Lord\\nalways\\nbe-\\nfore my\\nface,\\nfor he\\nis on my\\nright\\nhand, that I should not be moved\\n:\\n26. Therefore did my heart rejoice,\\nand my\\ntongue was\\nglad; moreover\\nalso my flesh shall rest in hope:\\n27.

Men and brethren, let me freely\\nspeak unto you of the patriarch David,\\nthat he\\nis both dead and buried, and\\nhis sepulchre\\nis with us unto this day.\\n30. Therefore being a prophet, and\\nknowing that God had sworn with an\\noath\\nto him,\\nthat of the\\nfruit of his\\nloins, according to the flesh, he would\\nraise up Christ to sit on his throne\\n;\\n31. He seeing\\nthis before spake of\\nthe\\nresurrection\\nof\\nChrist,\\nthat\\nhis\\nsoul was not\\nleft in\\nhell, neither his\\nflesh did see corruption.\\n32. This Jesus hath God raised up,\\nwhereof we\\nall are witnesses.\\n33. Therefore\\nbeing by\\nthe\\nright\\nhand of God exalted, and having re-\\nceived\\nof\\nthe Father the promise of\\nthe Holy\\nGhost, he hath\\nshed\\nforth\\nthis, which ye now see and hear.\\n34. For David\\nis not ascended into\\nthe\\nheavens:\\nbut\\nhe\\nsaith\\nhimself.\\nThe Lord\\nsaid\\nunto my\\nLord,\\nSit\\nthou on my right hand,\\n35. Until I make thy foes thy foot-\\nstool.\\n36.

Now\\nwhen\\nthey\\nheard\\nthis,\\nthey were pricked in their heart, and\\nsaid unto Peter and to the rest of the\\napostles. Men and brethren, what shall\\nwe do?\\n38.

And\\nas\\nPeter was\\ncoming\\nin,\\nCornelius\\nmet\\nhim,\\nand\\nfell down\\nat his feet, and worshipped him.\\n26. But Peter took him up, saying,\\nStand up;\\nI myself\\nalso am\\na man.\\n27. And as he talked with him, he\\nwent\\nin, and found many that were\\ncome together.\\n28. And\\nhe\\nsaid\\nunto\\nthem, Ye\\nknow how that it is an unlawful thing\\nfor a man that\\nis a Jew to keep com-\\npany,\\nor come\\nunto\\none\\nof\\nanother\\nnation; but God hath shewed me that\\nI\\nshould not\\ncall any man common\\nor unclean.\\n29. Therefore\\ncame\\nI\\nunto\\nyou\\nwithout gainsaying, as soon as I was\\nsent\\nfor:\\nI\\nask\\ntherefore\\nfor what\\n*ntent ye have sent for me?\\n30. And Cornelius\\nsaid, Four days\\nago I was fasting until this hour; and\\nat\\nthe\\nninth hour\\nI\\nprayed\\nin my\\nhouse, and, behold, a man stood before\\nme in bright clothing,\\n31. And said, Cornelius, thy prayer\\nis heard, and thine alms\\nare had in\\nremembrance in the sight of God.\\n32.

For\\nsin\\nshall not have domin-\\nion\\nover you:\\nfor ye\\nare not under\\nthe law, but under grace,\\n15. What\\nthen?\\nshall we\\nsin,\\nbe-\\ncause we are not under the law, but\\nunder grace? God forbid.\\n16. Know ye not, that to whom ye\\nyield yourselves servants\\nto obey,\\nhis\\nservants\\nye\\nare\\nto whom\\nye\\nobey;\\nwhether of sin unto death, or of obedi-\\nence unto righteousness?\\n17. But God be\\nthanked,\\nthat ye\\nwere the servants of\\nsin, but ye have\\nobeyed from\\nthe\\nheart that form of\\ndoctrine which was delivered you.\\n18. Being then made free from sin,\\nye became the\\nservants\\nof righteous-\\nness.\\n19\\nI speak after the manner of men\\nbecause of the infirmity of your flesh:\\nfor as ye have yielded your members\\nservants to uncleanness and to iniquity\\nunto iniquity; even so now yield your\\nmembers\\nservants\\nto\\nrighteousness\\nunto holiness.\\n20. For when ye were the servants\\nof\\nsin, ye were\\nfree from\\nrighteous-\\nness.\\n21. What fruit had ye then in those\\nthings whereof ye are now ashamed?\\nfor the end of those things\\nis death.\\n22. But now being made free from\\nsin, and become\\nservants\\nto God, ye\\nhave your fruit unto holiness, and the\\nend everlasting life.\\n23.\\nFor the wages of sin\\nis death;\\nbut\\nthe\\ngift\\nof God\\nis\\neternal\\nlife\\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord.\\nChapter 8\\n1. There\\nis\\ntherefore now no con-\\ndemnation to them which are in Christ\\nJesus, who walk not\\nafter\\nthe\\nflesh,\\nbut after the Spirit.\\n2. For the law of the Spirit of\\nlife\\nin\\nChrist\\nJesus\\nhath made me\\nfree\\nfrom the law of sin and death.\\n3. For what the law could not do,\\nin that it was weak through the flesh,\\nGod sending his own Son in the like-\\nness\\nof\\nsinful\\nflesh, and for\\nsin, con-\\ndemned sin in the flesh:\\n4. That the righteousness of the law\\nmight be fulfilled in us, who walk not\\nafter the flesh, but after the Spirit.\\n5. For they that are after the flesh\\ndo mind the things\\nof the\\nflesh; but\\nthey that are after the Spirit the things\\nof the Spirit.\\n6. For\\nto\\nbe\\ncarnally\\nminded\\nis\\ndeath;\\nbut\\nto\\nbe\\nspiritually minded\\nis life and peace.\\n7. Because\\nthe carnal mind\\nis\\nen-\\nmity against God : for it is not subject\\nto the law of God, neither indeed can\\nbe.\\n8. So\\nthen\\nthey\\nthat\\nare\\nin\\nthe\\nflesh cannot please God.\\n9. But ye are not in the\\nflesh, but\\nin the\\nSpirit,\\nif so be that the\\nSpirit\\nof God dwell in you. Now if any man\\nhave\\nnot\\nthe\\nSpirit\\nof\\nChrist, he\\nis\\nnone of his.\\n10. And\\nif\\nChrist be\\nin\\nyou,\\nthe\\nbody\\nis dead because of sin; but the\\nSpirit\\nis\\nlife because of righteousness.\\n11. But\\nif\\nthe\\nSpirit\\nof him\\nthat\\nraised up Jesus from the dead dwell\\nin you, he that raised up Christ from\\nthe dead shall also quicken your mor-\\ntal bodies by his\\niSpirit that dwelleth\\nin you.\\n12. Therefore,\\nbrethren,\\nwe\\nare\\nTHE NEW TESTAMENT\\n265\\ndebtors, not to the flesh, to live after\\nthe flesh.\\n13. For if ye live after the flesh, ye\\nshan die: but if ye through the Spirit\\ndo mortify the deeds of the body, ye\\nshall\\nlive.\\n14. For as many\\nas are led by the\\nSpirit\\nof God,\\nthey are\\nthe\\nsons of\\nGod.\\n15. For ye have\\nnot received\\nthe\\nspirit\\nof bondage again to\\nfear; but\\nye have received the\\nSpirit of adop-\\ntion, whereby we\\ncry,\\nAbba,\\nFather.\\n16. The Spirit itself beareth witness\\nwith our\\nspirit, that we are the\\nchil-\\ndren of God:\\n17. And\\nif\\nchildren,\\nthen\\nheirs;\\nheirs\\nof\\nGod,\\nand\\njoint-heirs\\nwith\\nChrist;\\nif so be\\nthat we\\nsuffer with\\nhim,\\nthat we may\\nbe\\nalso\\nglorified\\ntogether.\\n18. For I reckon that the sufferings\\nof this present time are not worthy to\\nbe compared\\nwith\\nthe\\nglory which\\nshall be revealed in us.\\n19. For the\\nearnest\\nexpectation of\\nthe creature waiteth for the manifesta-\\ntion of the sons of God.\\n20. For the creature was made sub-\\nject\\nto\\nvanity,\\nnot\\nwillingly,\\nbut by\\nreason of him who hath subjected the\\nsame in hope,\\n21. Because the creature itself also\\nshall be\\ndelivered from\\nthe bondage\\nof corruption into the\\nglorious liberty\\nof the children of God.\\n22. For we know\\nthat the whole\\ncreation\\ngroaneth\\nand\\ntravaileth\\nin\\npain together until now.\\n23. And\\nnot\\nonly\\nthey,\\nbut\\nour-\\nselves\\nalso, which have the\\nfirstfruits\\nof the Spirit, even we ourselves groan\\nwithin ourselves, waiting for the adop-\\ntion,\\nto\\nwit,\\nthe\\nredemption of our\\nbody.\\n24. For we are saved by hope: but\\nhope that is seen is not hope:\\nfor what\\na man\\nseeth, why doth he\\nyet hope\\nfor?\\n25. But\\nif we hope for that we see\\nnot, then do we with patience wait for\\nit.\\n26. Likewise the Spirit also helpeth\\nour infirmities:\\nfor we know not what\\nwe should pray for as we ought:\\nbut\\nthe\\nSpirit\\nitself maketh\\nintercession\\nfor us with groanings which cannot be\\nuttered.\\n27. And\\nhe\\nthat\\nsearcheth\\nthe\\nhearts knoweth what\\nis\\nthe mind of\\nthe Spirit, because he maketh interces-\\nsion\\nfor\\nthe\\nsaints according\\nto\\nthe\\nwill of God.\\n28. And we know\\nthat\\nall\\nthings\\nwork together\\nfor good to them that\\nlove God, to them who are the called\\naccording to his purpose.\\n29. For whom he did foreknow, he\\nalso did predestinate to be conformed\\nto the image of his Son, that he might\\nbe the firstborn among many brethren.\\n30. Moreover whom he did predes-\\ntinate, them he also called : and whom\\nhe called, them he also justified: and\\nwhom he justified, them he also glori-\\nfied.\\n31. What shall we then say to these\\nthings?\\nIf God be for us, who can be\\nagainst us ?\\n32. He that spared not his own Son,\\nbut delivered him up for us\\nall, how\\nshall he not with him also freely give\\nus\\nall things?\\n33. Who shall lay any thing to the\\ncharge of God’s elect? It\\nis God that\\njustifieth.\\n34. Who is he that condemneth? It\\nis Christ that died, 3^ea rather, that is\\nrisen again, who\\nis even at the right\\nhand\\nof God, who\\nalso maketh\\nin-\\ntercession for us.\\n35. Who shall separate us from the\\nlove\\nof\\nChrist?\\nshall\\ntribulation,\\nor\\ndistress, or persecution, or famine, or\\nnakedness, or peril, or sword?\\n36. As it is written. For thy sake we\\nare killed\\nall the day long; we are ac-\\ncounted as sheep for the slaughter.\\n37. Nay, in\\nall these things we are\\nmore\\nthan\\nconquerors\\nthrough\\nhim\\nthat loved us.\\n266\\nCHRISTIANITY\\n38. For\\nI\\nam\\npersuaded,\\nthat\\nneither death, nor life, nor angels, nor\\nprincipalities, nor powers, nor things\\npresent, nor things to come,\\n39. Nor height, nor depth, nor any\\nother creature,\\nshall be able to sepa-\\nrate us from the love of God, which is\\nin Christ Jesus our Lord.\\nChapter 10\\n10. For with the heart man believ-\\neth unto righteousness ; and with the\\nmouth confession\\nis made unto salva-\\ntion.\\n11. For the scripture saith, Whoso-\\never\\nbelieveth on him\\nshall\\nnot\\nbe\\nashamed.\\n12. For\\nthere\\nis no\\ndifference\\nbe-\\ntween\\nthe Jew and\\nthe\\nGreek:\\nfor\\nthe same Lord over\\nall\\nis\\nrich unto\\nall that call upon him.\\n13. For whosoever\\nshall\\ncall upon\\nthe name of the Lord shall be saved.\\n14.

And hereby we do know that we\\nknow him,\\nif we keep\\nhis command-\\nments.\\n4. He that saith,\\nI know him, and\\nkeepeth not\\nhis commandments,\\nis a\\nliar, and the truth is not in him.\\n5.

Again,\\na new commandment\\nI\\nwrite unto you, which thing is true in\\nhim and in you : because the darkness\\nis past, and the true light now shineth.\\n9.

And\\nevery man\\nthat hath\\nthis\\nhope in him purifieth himself, even as\\nhe is pure.\\n4. Whosoever committeth sin trans-\\ngresseth\\nalso\\nthe law:\\nfor\\nsin\\nis\\nthe\\ntransgression of the law.\\n5.

He that committeth sin\\nis of the\\ndevil; for the devil sinneth from the\\nbeginning. For this purpose the Son of\\nGod was\\nmanifested,\\nthat he might\\ndestroy the works of the devil.\\n9. Whosoever\\nis born of God doth\\nnot commit sin; for his seed remain-\\neth in him : and he cannot sin, because\\nhe\\nis born of God.\\n10. In this the children of God are\\nmanifest, and the children of the devil\\n:\\nwhosoever doeth not\\nrighteousness\\nis\\nnot\\nof God,\\nneither\\nhe\\nthat\\nloveth\\nnot\\nhis\\nbrother.\\n11. For this\\nis the message that ye\\nheard\\nfrom\\nthe\\nbeginning,\\nthat we\\nshould love one another.\\n12. Not\\nas Gain, who was of that\\nwicked one, and slew his brother. And\\nwherefore\\nslew he him?\\nBecause\\nhis\\nown works were evil, and his brother’s\\nrighteous.\\n13. Marvel not, my brethren, if the\\nWorld hate you.\\n14. We know that we have passed\\nfrom death unto\\nlife, because we love\\nthe\\nbrethren. He\\nthat loveth not his\\nbrother abideth in death.\\n15. Whosoever hateth his brother\\nis\\na\\nmurderer:\\nand\\nye know\\nthat\\nno\\nmurderer hath eternal\\nlife abiding in\\nhim.\\n16. Hereby perceive we the love of\\nGod, because he laid down his life for\\nus:\\nand we ought\\nto day down our\\nlives for the brethren.\\n17. But\\nwhoso\\nhath\\nthis\\nworld’s\\ngood, and seeth his brother have need,\\nand shuttefh up his bowels of compas-\\nsion from him, how dwelleth the love\\nof God in him?\\n18. My\\nlittle\\nchildren,\\nlet\\nus\\nnot\\nlove in word, neither in tongue; but in\\ndeed and in truth.\\n19. And\\nhereby we know\\nthat we\\nare of the truth, and shall assure our\\nhearts before him.\\n20. For\\nif our\\nheart condemn\\nus,\\nGod\\nis\\n. greater\\nthan\\nour\\nheart,\\nand\\nknoweth all things.\\n21.

And whatsoever we ask, we re-\\nceive\\nof\\nhim,\\nbecause we\\nkeep\\nhis\\ncommandments, and do\\nthose\\nthings\\nthat are pleasing in his sight.\\n23. And\\nthis\\nis\\nhis commandment.\\nThat we should believe on the name\\nof his Son Jesus Christ, and love one\\nanother, as he gave us commandment.\\n24. And he\\nthat keepeth\\nhis com-\\nmandments\\ndwelleth\\nin him, and he\\nin him. And hereby we know that he\\nabideth in us, by the\\nSpirit which he\\nhath given us.\\nChapter 4\\n7. Beloved, let us love one another:\\nfor love is of God; and every one that\\nloveth\\nis born of God, and knoweth\\nGod.\\n8. He that loveth not knoweth not\\nGod ; for God\\nis love,\\n9. In\\nthis was manifested\\nthe love\\nof God toward\\nus, because that God\\nsent\\nhis\\nonly\\nbegotten Son\\ninto\\nthe\\nworld, that we might live through him.\\n302\\nCHRISTIANITY\\n10. Herein\\nis\\nlove,\\nnot\\nthat\\nwe\\nloved God, but that he loved us, and\\nsent his Son to be the propitiation for\\nour\\nsins.\\n11.

No man hath seen God at any\\ntime.\\nIf we\\nlove\\none\\nanother, God\\ndwelleth\\nin\\nus, and\\nhis\\nlove\\nis\\nper-\\nfected in us.\\n13. Hereby know we that we dwell\\nin him, and he in us, because he hath\\ngiven us of his Spirit.\\n14. And we have seen and do testify\\nthat the Father sent the Son to be the\\nSaviour of the world.\\n15. Whosoever\\nshall\\nconfess\\nthat\\nJesus\\nis the Son of God, God dwelleth\\nin him, and he in God.\\n16. And we have known and\\nbe-\\nlieved the love\\nthat God hath\\nto\\nus.\\nGod\\nis\\nlove,* and he that dwelleth in\\nlove dwelleth in God, and God in him.\\n1 7. Herein is our love made perfect,\\nthat we may have boldness in the day\\nof judgment:\\nbecause as he\\nis, so are\\nwe in this world.\\n18. There\\nis no\\nfear\\nin\\nlove; but\\nperfect love casteth out fear:\\nbecause\\nfear\\nhath\\ntorment. He\\nthat\\nfeareth\\nis not made perfect in love.\\n19. We\\nlove him, because he\\nfirst\\nloved us.\\n20.\\nIf a man\\nsay,\\nI love God, and\\nhateth his brother, he is a liar:\\nfor he\\nthat loveth not his brother whom he\\nhath seen, how can he love God whom\\nhe hath not seen?\\n21. And\\nthis commandment\\nhave\\nwe from\\nhim,\\nThat he who\\nloveth\\nGod love his brother also.\\nChapter 5\\n1. Whosoever\\nbelieveth\\nthat\\nJesus\\nis the Christ is born of God : and every\\none that loveth him that begat loveth\\nhim also that is begotten of him.\\n2. By this we know that we love the\\nchildren\\nof God, when we love God,\\nand keep his commandments.\\n3. For this\\nis the love of God, that\\nwe keep\\nhis commandments:\\nand his\\ncommandments are not grievous.\\n4. For whatsoever\\nis born\\nof God\\novercometh the world : and this\\nis the\\nvictory\\nthat\\novercometh\\nthe\\nworld,\\neven our faith.\\n5. Who\\nis he\\nthat overcometh the\\nworld, but he that believeth that Jesus\\nis the Son of God?\\n6. This\\nis\\nhe\\nthat came by water\\nand blood, even Jesus Christ; not by\\nwater\\nonly, but by water and\\nblood.\\nAnd\\nit\\nis the Spirit that beareth wit-\\nness, because the Spirit\\nis truth.\\n7. For\\nthere\\nare\\nthree\\nthat\\nbear\\nrecord\\nin\\nheaven,\\nthe\\nFather,\\nthe\\nWord, and the Holy Ghost: and these\\nthree are one.\\n8. And\\nthere\\nare\\nthree\\nthat\\nbear\\nwitness\\nin\\nearth,\\nthe\\nspirit, and\\nthe\\nwater, and the blood: and these three\\nagree in one.\\n9.\\nIf we receive the witness of men,\\nthe witness of God\\nis greater:\\nfor this\\nis the witness\\nof God which he hath\\ntestified of his Son.\\n10. He that believeth on the Son of\\nGod hath the\\nwitness\\nin\\nhimself:\\nhe\\nthat believeth not God hath made him\\na\\nliar; because he\\nbelieveth\\nnot\\nthe\\nrecord that God gave of his Son.\\n11. And this is the record, that God\\nhath given to us eternal\\nlife, and\\nthis\\nlife\\nis in his Son.\\n12. He that hath the Son hath life;\\nand he that hath not the Son of God\\nhath not life.\\n13. These\\nthings\\nhave\\nI\\nwritten\\nunto you that believe on the name of\\nthe Son\\nof God;\\nthat ye may know\\nthat ye have eternal\\nlife, and that ye\\nmay believe on the name\\nof the Son\\nof God.\\n14. And\\nthis\\nis the confidence that\\nwe have in him,\\nthat,\\nif we ask any\\nthing according to his will, he heareth\\nus:\\n15.

And out of the throne proceeded\\nlightnings and thunderings and voices\\nand\\nthere\\nwere\\nseven\\nlamps\\nof\\nfire\\nburning before the throne, which are\\nthe seven\\nSpirits\\nof God.\\n6. And before the throne there was\\na\\nsea\\nof\\nglass\\nlike unto\\ncrystal: and\\nin the midst of the throne, and round\\nabout the throne, were four beasts full\\nof eyes before and behind.\\n7. And\\nthe\\nfirst\\nbeast was\\nlike\\na\\nlion, and the second beast like a calf,\\nand the\\nthird beast had a face as a\\nman, and the fourth beast was like a\\nflying eagle.\\n8.

In\\nIndia\\nalone\\nthere\\nare more than 68,000,000 Moham-\\nmedans, while the entire number of believers has been estimated as\\nabove 221,000,000. With the exception of Sikhism, it is the newest of\\nthe world’s great religions, dating from the Hegira, or flight of the\\nprophet from Mecca, 622 a.d.\\nMohammed, the founder, was born in 570 a.d. at Mecca, the chief\\ncity of Arabia, and followed\\nhis tribal business\\nof shepherding and\\ntrading for many years. As a trader, he traveled much and came into\\ncontact with many\\npeoples\\nof\\nvaried\\nreligious\\nbeliefs. The\\ngeneral\\nmoral and social degradation which he found everywhere inspired him\\nto devote himself to reform. This led\\nto a conviction that God had\\ngiven him a special appointment to preach a new religion. Then came\\n“visions” and long “talks” with Allah whose prophet he believed him-\\nself to be.\\nAt the age of 52, Mohammed went to Medina where he\\nset him-\\nself up as the dictator and special envoy of Allah. His following in-\\ncreased rapidly. When he felt himself strong enough, he returned\\nto\\nMecca, from which he had\\nfled\\nin\\n622, ,and from\\nthere\\nruled\\nall\\nArabia. Mecca became the hub of a great wheel\\nof Mohammedan\\nfaith from which spokes radiated in every direction and from which\\nrepresentatives went\\nto many\\nnations demanding that\\nthey\\naccept\\nhis faith.\\nMohammed died of a fever in 632\\na.d,, at the age of 62, believing\\nthat he would be translated immediately to “the blessed companion-\\nship on high”.\\nHis death left the powerful movement which he had founded with-\\nout a successor or leader. For 28 years his devoted followers carried\\non the work and the leadership of the movement was held successively\\nby Abu Bekr, Omar, Othman, and Ali, each one known as a caliph.\\nAfter the death of Ali by assassination, the movement broke up into\\n305\\n306\\nMOHAMMEDANISM\\nsects\\nor\\ndifferent\\ncaliphates,\\neach\\nfighting\\nagainst\\nthe\\nothers.\\nAt\\npresent there are approximately 72 distinct sects or denominations with\\nbeliefs and doctrines often far apart. Indeed, Mohammedanism has\\ntended to take on something of the color of the culture into which\\nit\\nhas migrated.\\nAlthough Mohammed\\nis found\\nin some\\nplaces\\nin\\nthe Koran\\nto\\nbemean himself as a common man and “the\\nilliterate prophet”,\\nin\\nother places he is so closely associated with Allah as to give ground for\\nthe belief that he was superhuman. Thus, after his death his followers\\ncame more and more\\nto worship him\\nas a prophet second\\nonly\\nto\\nAllah. Numerous miracle\\nstories grew up about his\\nlife and he was\\nvenerated with absolute devotion.\\nChief among the doctrines of Mohammedanism is the conception of\\nAllah as the one and supreme being. This was “monotheism”, belief\\nin one and only one God. Allah is claimed to be “absolutely unitary”,\\n‘^all^seeing”, “all-hearing”, “all-speaking”, “all-knowing”, “all-willing”,\\nand “all-powerful”. Other beliefs prominent in Mohammedanism are:\\nbelief in angels, belief in the Koran as a book coming directly from\\nAllah,\\nbelief in Mohammed as the prophet of Allah,\\nbelief in judg-\\nment, paradise, and hell, and belief in the divine law of Allah which\\npredestines everything for man and the world.\\nMohammedanism holds that man has five supreme duties which he\\nneglects at his soul’s peril. These are :\\nrepetition of the creed, prayer,\\nalmsgiving,\\nfasting, and pilgrimage\\nto Mecca. Every Mohammedan\\nmust, once in his life, travel to Mecca, walk around the sacred Mosque,\\nand kiss the Black Stone of\\nKaaha, or shrine, seven times.\\nIf this\\ntrip\\nis entirely impossible, he may send a substitute, but this is allowed\\nonly as a last resort.\\nTHE KORAN\\nThe Koran\\nsacred book of the Mohammedans,\\nis avowed to be a\\ndirect\\nrevelation\\nof God\\nto\\nthe prophet Mohammed. Throughout\\nAllah speaks, sometimes directly to Mohammed and at others through\\nthe mouth of the prophet.\\nA little more than a year after the death of Mohammed, Abu Bekr,\\nwho took over the movement, supervised the collecting and writing of\\nthe teachings of the prophet as they were remembered by those who\\nknew him best. But this did not settle the question of what the prophet\\nhad\\nactually\\nsaid.\\nConsequently, some\\ntwelve\\nyears\\nlater Othman,\\nthird caliph, commanded that all copies of the original work be de-\\nstroyed and a new and authentic version be prepared. This accepted\\nvolume contains\\nscraps of beliefs from many religious\\nsources,\\nchief\\nof which are Arabic traditions and folk lore, Zoroastrianism, and Jew-\\nish and Christian theology.\\nThe present Koran consists of 114 suras or chapters. The\\nfirst\\nis a\\nshort prayer,\\nthe famous Fatihah, The remaining\\n113\\nchapters are\\narranged in the order of their length, the first having 286 verses and\\nthe last having only three verses.\\nThe Koran has been the most influential book in Arabic literature,\\nbeing quoted by\\npractically\\nevery important Arabic\\nwriter. At\\nthe\\nmodern Mohammedan university of Al-Azhar in Cairo\\nit\\nis the chief\\ntextbook which every student must know*\\nSural\\n1.\\nPraise be\\nto God,\\nLord\\nof the\\nworlds!\\n2.

How can ye withhold faith from\\nGod? Ye were dead and He\\ngave you\\nlife; next He will\\ncause you\\nto\\ndie; next He\\nwill restore you to life: next\\nshall ye return to Him!\\n27. He\\nit\\nis who created for you\\nall\\nthat\\nis on Earth, then pro-\\nceeded\\nto\\nthe Heaven, and\\ninto seven Heavens did He\\nfashion\\nit: and He knoweth\\nall things.\\n28. When\\nthy\\nLord\\nsaid\\nto\\nthe\\nangels,\\n“Verily,\\nI am about\\nto place one in my stead on\\nearth,” they said, “Wilt thou\\nplace there one who will do\\nill\\ntherein and\\nshed\\nblood,\\nwhen we celebrate thy praise\\nand extol thy holiness ?” God\\nsaid,\\n“Verily,\\nI know what\\nye know not.”\\n29. And he taught Adam the names\\nof\\nall\\nthings, and\\nthen\\nset\\nthem before the angels, and\\nsaid, “Tell me the names of\\nthese, if ye are\\nendued with\\nwisdom.”\\n30. They\\nsaid,\\n“Praise be\\nto Thee!\\nWe have no knowledge but\\nwhat Thou hast given us to\\nknow. Thou! Thou\\nart the\\nKnowing, the Wise.”\\n31. He said, “O Adam, inform them\\nof their names.” And when\\nhe\\nhad\\ninformed them\\nof\\ntheir names, He said, “Did I\\nnot say to you that\\nI know\\nthe\\nhidden\\nthings\\nof\\nthe\\nHeavens and\\nof\\nthe\\nEarth,\\nand\\nthat\\nI know what\\nye\\nbring\\nto\\nlight, and what ye\\nhide?”\\n32. And when we said to the angels,\\n“Bow\\ndown\\nand\\nworship\\nAdam,”\\nthen\\nworshipped\\nthey\\nall, save\\nEblis. He\\nre-\\nfused\\nand\\nswelled\\nwith\\npride, and became\\none\\nof\\nthe unbelievers.\\n33. And we\\nsaid, “O Adam!\\ndwell\\nthou\\nand\\nthy\\nwife\\nin\\nthe\\nGarden, and\\neat ye\\nplenti-\\nfully therefrom wherever ye\\nlist;\\nbut\\nto\\nthis\\ntree come\\nnot nigh,\\nlest ye become of\\nthe transgressors.”\\n34. But Satan made them\\nslip from\\nit, and caused their banish-\\nment\\nfrom\\nthe\\nplace\\nin\\nwhich\\nthey\\nwere. And we\\nTHE KORAN\\n3D9\\nsaid,“Get ye down, the one\\nof\\nyou\\nan\\nenemy\\nto\\nthe\\nother: and there shall be for\\nyou in the earth a dwelling-\\nplace, and a provision for a\\ntime,”\\n35. And\\nwords\\nof\\nprayer\\nlearned\\nAdam from\\nhis Lord:\\nand\\nGod turned to him; for He\\nioveth to turn, the Merciful.\\n36.

But they who\\nshall not believe,\\nand treat our signs as false-\\nhoods, these shall be inmates\\nof the\\nfire; in\\nit\\nshall they\\nremain\\nfor ever.”\\n98.

And attend to\\nthis;\\nfor,\\nthe\\nInfidels\\nshall\\nsuffer\\na\\ngrievous\\nchastise-\\nment.\\n99.

Praise be to God, who hath cre-\\nated\\nthe Heavens and\\nthe\\nEarth,\\nand\\nordained\\nthe\\ndarkness and the\\nlight! Yet\\nunto\\ntheir Lord do the\\nin-\\nfidels give peers!\\n2.

And thrust not thou away those\\nwho\\ncry\\nto\\ntheir Lord\\nat\\nmorn and\\neven,\\ncraving\\nto\\nbehold his face.

And when\\nthey who\\nbelieve\\nin\\nour signs come to thee, Say:\\nPeace\\nbe upon\\nyou!\\nYour\\nLord\\nhath\\nlaid\\ndown\\nfor\\nhimself a law of mercy; so\\nthat if any one of you com-\\nmit\\na\\nfault\\nthrough\\nigno-\\nrance, and\\nafterwards turn\\nand amend.

According to some authori-\\nties,\\nit \\'‘unquestionably represents the\\ndistinctive\\nreligious\\ngenius of\\nJapan from the very beginning of its history”. Others, while recogniz-\\ning its deep significance for Japanese life, argue that it is in no sense a\\nreligion but\\nis rather a patriotic cult. Whether we call it a religion or\\nnot, it has unquestionably made a significant contribution to the polit-\\nical theory and national stability of Japan.\\nAccording to Shinto, the islands of Japan were the\\nfirst pieces of\\nland created by the gods and are thus designed to be the center of the\\nworld. The first Japanese Emperor was, the scriptures of Shinto teach,\\nthe direct descendant of the heavenly Sun Goddess. He\\nis, thereby,\\nchosen to rule the entire world from his islands and to function as the\\nrepresentative and emissary of the divine. All emperors of Japan are\\nbelieved to be direct descendants of this first Emperor and thus of the\\nSun Goddess. Consequently, they too have the divine authority to rule\\nthe world.\\nSo thoroughly has\\nthis\\nbelief been\\nfostered in the minds\\nof\\nthe\\nJapanese by Shinto that the Constitution of 1889 begins by declaring\\nthat the Mikado sits upon “the throne of a lineal succession unbroken\\nfor ages\\neternal” and that he has\\nall the authority which the Sun\\nGoddess gave to the first Emperor.\\nHowever, Shinto has for 1440 years coexisted and intermingled with\\nother religions, chief among which are Confucianism, Buddhism, and\\nTaoism, to such an extent that even its name today\\nis Chinese. The\\nJapanese name is Kami-no Michiy translated “The Way of the Gods”.\\nBut this has been translated into Chinese as\\nthe tao being the\\nsame as we find it in Taoism. This form has been shortened to Shinto.\\nTwo\\nwritings\\nare fundamental\\nto\\nShinto and have become\\nthe\\nsacred scriptures of the religion. Both make the claim of being purely\\nhistorical,\\nalthough\\nthey\\nare loaded with myths,\\nlegends, and un-\\nfounded tales. The earliest of these documents is the Kojiki or Records\\nm\\n348\\nSHINTO\\nof Ancient Matt\\nThis work dates from 712\\na.d. and professes\\nto\\ntell the story of the “Age of the Gods”, before men were created, and\\nof\\nthe\\nearly emperors. This book was followed\\nin 720\\na.p. by\\nthe\\nNihongi or\\nChronicles\\nof Japan.\\nThis work\\ntells\\nthe\\nstories\\nof\\nthe\\nemperors of Japan, recites their genealogies, and claims to quote them\\non various matters.\\nOne feature of the Kojiki needs mentioning. Christian readers may\\nfind some parts of it morally offensive. Indeed, numerous passages are\\nso objectionable to Western minds that the English translator refused\\nto render them into English, but turned to Latin for the translation.\\nThe Engishiki ox Institutes of the Period of Engi^ another of the\\nsacred documents of Shinto,\\ntells the story of the\\nrise of the Shinto\\ncult and contains 25\\nprayers\\nfor various ceremonial\\noccasions.\\nThis\\nwork comes from the tenth century.\\nStill another portion of Shinto scripture is iht Manyoshu or CoUec->\\ntion\\nof Ten Thousand Leaves^ an anthology\\nof 4496 poems dating\\nfrom the fifth to the eighth centuries.\\nThe gods of Shinto are untold in number. They are said in one\\nplace to number 80 myriads and in another to number 800 myriads.\\nThese gods lived as men and women, subject to\\nall the passions of\\nhuman beings. One of the most important among these\\ndeities was\\nthe sun, an indication of the nature worship fundamental to\\nthis re-\\nligion. However, the sun is not thought of as being male, as in other\\nreligions where the sun is worshiped. It is female and is the source of\\nthe line of Japanese emperors. Because of\\nthis,\\nthe Mikado\\nis wor-\\nshiped as divine and is held to be sacred, inviolable, and infallible for\\nall time. So sacred is the Emperor that until 1922 no one was permitted\\nto look down upon him even in a physical sense. Since that time the\\nMikado has, as Prince, moved among the people to some extent, even\\npassing along the streets of various cities in Japan.\\nWorship of the Sun Goddess\\nis emblemized in the national flag of\\nJapan, a rising sun. This religious and patriotic symbol means to each\\nJapanese a promise that, as all the world depends for its life upon the\\nsun,\\nso\\nit must depend\\nfor\\nits\\npolitical\\nlife upon Japan and\\neach\\nJapanese\\nis divinely commissioned to force the rule of the Sun God-\\ndess upon the rest of the world.\\nKOJIKI\\nTwe Kojikh OT Records of Ancient Matters, was completed in 712 a .d .\\nThough its date of completion is late, it records for us the most ancient\\nmythology, legends, and traditional history of Japan. Soon after\\nthis\\nwork was compiled\\nthe\\nold Japanese\\nculture was\\nso\\ninfused with\\nChinese culture as to\\nlose almost\\nall of\\nits\\noriginality. But\\nthis book\\ngives us the story of ancient Japan in an almost pure form.\\nThe book\\nis a pseudo-historical account of the\\nlives and deeds of\\nJapan’s rulers. It begins with the ancient legends of the creation of the\\ndeities and the formation of the\\nislands\\nof Japan. As\\nin the\\nearly\\nlegends of other religions, this story begins with the forces of light and\\ndarkness eventually producing the universe and peopling it with many\\ndeities. These deities create the land and the people in it. Then follow\\nshort descriptions of the\\nlives of the emperors. All of these rulers are\\ndeclared to be divine, direct descendants of the early deities.\\nWe have selected the accounts of the creation of the universe and\\nparticularly of the islands of Japan.\\nVol. I.—Preface:\\nI Yasumaro say:\\nNow when chaos had begun to con-\\ndense, but\\nforce and form were\\nnot\\nyet\\nmanifest, and\\nthere was\\nnought\\nnamed, nought done, who could know\\nits\\nshape?\\nNevertheless Heaven and\\nEarth first parted, and the Three Dei-\\nties performed the commencement of\\ncreation;\\nthe\\nPassive and\\nActive\\nEs-\\nsences then developed, and the Two\\nSpirits\\nbecame\\nthe\\nancestors\\nof\\nall\\nthings.

Though\\nsmall in number, only Zoroastrianism and Jainism being smaller, and\\nthough founded within modern times, Sikhism has exerted considera-\\nble influence upon the religious life of the East, all the way from the\\nnorth of India to Ceylon.\\nNevertheless, Sikhism has remained con-\\ncentrated largely in the Punjab, approximately 95 per cent of\\nall the\\nSikhs in the world being found there today.\\nTravelers to India find themselves drawn to two great masterpieces\\nof\\narchitecture:\\nthe\\nbeautiful Mohammedan monument,\\nthe\\nTaj\\nMahal, at Agra; and the Golden Temple in the Pool of Immortality\\nat Amritsar. The latter is the central shrine of Sikhism, and has been\\ncalled by some authorities one of the most magnificent\\nsights in\\nall\\nIndia. Here one finds a great pool of water over which passes a marble\\ncauseway to a splendid temple with a gilded dome and many cupolas,\\n“one of those rare sights seen at intervals during life which fix them-\\nselves indelibly on the memory”.\\nSikhism grew out of an attempt to harmonize Mohammedanism and\\nHinduism, the monotheism of the one and the mystic pantheism of the\\nother. This attempt was made by Nanak, the precocious son of com-\\nmon villagers, born in a little town about 30 miles southwest of Lahore,\\nthe capital of Punjab. During his childhood and youth he found no\\ninterest in the ways of men and devoted himself wholly to religious\\nthought and practices much to the consternation of his parents and\\nrelatives, even though his mother was a highly religious woman.\\nWhile Still a young man he came to the conclusion that “there is no\\nHindu and no Musalman”, but that both were united under the One\\nTrue God of all people. He went through the country preaching this\\ngospel,\\nvisiting\\nreligious\\nshrines, and\\nproclaiming\\nhis\\nbelief. These\\nefforts were highly successful and many were impressed or converted\\nby him and his faithful disciples.\\n355\\n356\\nSIKHISM\\nAs with many religious leaders, a host of miracle stories have been\\ntold about him. One\\nis that when he was about to die he went and\\nlay down under a withered acacia tree. Immediately the tree became\\ngreen, produced leaves and blossoms. These\\nstories, written into the\\nsacred scriptures of Sikhism, have served to make of Nanak a being\\napart from men and one to be worshiped by his followers.\\nThe Sikh scriptures\\nare known\\nas Granth, meaning ‘^The\\nBook’\".\\nThe original Granth, the Adi Granth, was compiled about 1604 by\\nthe\\nfifth Guru^ or “Religious Teacher”, from material that was be-\\nlieved to have come from Nanak and other Sikh teachers. This work\\nconsists of 29,480 rhymed verses from different authors and written in\\n31 different meters.\\nMore than a hundred years later another volume, consisting of works\\nof 37 authors, was issued under the title of the Dasam Granth or The\\nGranth of the Tenth Guru, This work\\nis accepted by most orthodox\\nSikhs as authoritative and is placed alongside of the Adi Granth,\\nSince Sikhism is an attempt to harmonize diverse religious positions,\\nits scriptures are written in a variety of languages. Among these are\\nPanjabi, Multani,\\nPersian,\\nPrakrit, Hindi, and Marathi, plus several\\nother dialects. Consequently, there are only a few people in the world\\nwho can read all these scriptures in their original languages and there\\nare probably no Sikhs who have read the entire works. Only small por-\\ntions of the Granths have been translated into English or made avail-\\nable to English scholars.\\nThe Sikh monarchy, set up soon after the death of Nanak, lasted\\nuntil some time after the death of the tenth Guru^ Govind Singh. Then\\nit broke up into several feudal states. These continued until 1849 when\\nthe political organization of Sikhism as a militant church state became\\nextinct. At this time Maharaja DhuHp Singh, the last independent Sikh\\nking, surrendered to the British and gave Queen Victoria the world-\\nfamous Koh-x-nur diamond. Nine years later Victoria became Empress\\nof India and the deposed king embraced Christianity.\\nToday most of\\ntlxe Sikhs\\nlive in the Punjab as farmers. However,\\nmany of them are to be found acting as bodyguards of provincial gov-\\nernors or serving as policemen throughout the Far Eastern possessions\\nof the British Empire,\\nTHE JAPJI\\nThis short document is held by the Sikhs to be the key to their scrip-\\ntures, the highest and most complete of their doctrinal statements.\\nIt\\nmust be known by all orthodox Sikhs and repeated early in the morn-\\ning. If a Sikh cannot read, he must have someone read\\nthis book\\nto\\nhim until he knows\\nit by heart and can repeat\\nit at the appointed\\ntime. It is believed that Guru Nanak wrote this himself sometime near\\nthe close of his life.\\nPreamble:\\nThere\\nis\\nbut\\none God\\nwhose name\\nis\\ntrue, the\\nCreator, de-\\nvoid\\nof\\nfear\\nand\\nenmity,\\nimmortal,\\nunborn,\\nself-existent;\\nby\\nthe\\nfavour\\nof the Guru.\\nREPEAT HIS NAME\\nThe True One was in the beginning;\\nthe True One was in the primal age.\\nThe True One\\nis now\\nalso, O Na-\\nnak; the True One also\\nshall be.\\n1.

The Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doc-\\ntrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price constitute the stand-\\nard works of the Church. They have other writings which th6y con-\\nsider inspired, but these four works occupy a unique position as the\\nsacred scripture of the Church.^\\nOne of the Articles of Faith of the Church states: “We believe all\\nthat God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe\\nthat He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to\\nthe Kingdom of God.” Throughout their history the Latter-day Saints\\nhave accepted the Bible as the word of God, but have also maintained\\nthat the canon of scripture was not filled with the Bible; that, as\\nis\\nmade evident in the Book of Mormon, in ancient times God revealed\\nHis will to people other than those mentioned in the Bible; that He\\nhas revealed His will in modern times, as found in the Doctrine and\\nCovenants and the Pearl of Great Price; and that He will yet further\\nreveal His will as the need arises.\\nThe Book of Mormon,\\nit\\nis believed,\\nis a record of peoples who\\nanciently inhabited the western hemisphere.

She had been deeply\\nimpressed by the assurances of Jesus that his followers should do the\\nworks that he did—assurances of which her mother often reminded\\nher. At the age of twelve, she succeeded in healing herself of a severe\\nfever through prayer, and occasionally after she was grown, without\\nknowing quite how she did\\nit, she had helped herself and others in a\\nsimilar manner. For years before her healing at Swampscott, she had\\nbeen seeking, as she writes {Retrospection and Introspection^ page 24),\\n\"\\'^to trace all physical effects to a mental cause”.\\nIn February, 1866, she fell on an icy pavement, and was taken up in\\nan apparently desperate condition. The physician who examined her\\nfound her partially unconscious. He said she appeared to be suffering\\nfrom a concussion and also possibly from a spinal dislocation. He gave\\nno hope of her recovery. On the third day afterward, when she was\\nstill considered to be hopelessly ill, she called for her Bible, and turned\\nto Matthew 9:2, the be^nning of the account of Jesus’ healing of the\\n“man sick of the palsy”. “As I read,” Mrs. Eddy has written {Miscel-\\nlaneous\\nWritings, page\\n24),\\n“the healing Truth dawned upon my\\nsense; and the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever\\nafter\\nwas in better health than I had before enjoyed.” She was able at once\\n>o walk into the next room where friends were mourning for her, and\\nassure them of her recovery,\\n^The material dealing with Christian Science was prepared with the assistance\\nof the Christian Science Committee on Publications and is released by The Chris-\\ndan Science Board of Directors.\\n379\\n380\\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE\\nHer great and persistent endeavor after this healing was to see just\\nhow\\nit had occurred. For three years she devoted herself almost ex-\\nclusively to study of the Bible, Gradually Christian Science, which she\\nalso has called the Science of Christianity, that\\nis, of the teaching and\\npractice of Jesus, unfolded in her thought; and she found presently\\nthat she could heal others, and know just how she healed them. Then\\nwithin a brief time she healed many others. She found also that she\\ncould teach Christian\\nScience,\\nso that those who studied with her\\ncould do like healing work.\\nThe numbers of those healed, and of her students, grew substantially\\nbefore she issued any printed work. In 1875, after thorough practical\\ntests of her discovery, she published the Christian Science textbook,\\nfirst called simply, Science and Health and subsequently Science and\\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures, which now has gone through many\\nhundreds of editions and is studied, in conjunction with the Bible, by\\nChristian Scientists everywhere.\\nMrs. Eddy at first hoped that Christian Science would be adopted\\nby the existing Christian churches. When this result seemed unlikely\\nto follow within a reasonable time, she established the Christian\\nSci-\\nence church, which now consists of The Mother Church—The First\\nChurch\\nof\\nChrist,\\nScientist,\\nin\\nBoston,\\nMassachusetts—^with\\n2,975\\nbranches in 40 countries.^\\nTo further the healing and educational work of Christian Science,\\nMrs. Eddy published several other books, and\\nestablished\\nfive\\nperi-\\nodicals—the monthly\\nScience Journal, the quarterly Chris-\\ntian\\nScience\\nBible\\nLessons,\\nthe monthly and\\nquarterly Herald\\nof\\nChristian Science, now published in seven languages and Braille, and\\nthe\\ninternational\\ndaily newspaper, The\\nChristian\\nScience Monitor.\\nShe also established a Board of Lectureship, whose members regularly\\ndeliver lectures wherever there are branches of The Mother Church,\\nand the public practice of Christian Science healing, the recognized\\npractitioners of which now number many thousands in many countries.\\nShe provided in addition for the free public Reading Rooms, which\\nare maintained by all Christian Science churches.\\nAmong the published works of Mrs. Eddy\\nis the Church Manual,\\ncontaining by-laws under which The Mother Church and its branches\\nare governed. These by-laws provide for, and are administered under\\nthe\\ndirection\\nof, The\\nChristian Science Board\\nof\\nDirectors, whose\\noffices are in Boston, Massachusetts.\\n^hese figures include the branches which were functioning in Axis countries\\njust before the beginning of hostilities in 1939.\\nSCIENCE AND HEALTH\\nThe BASIC LITERATURE of Christian Science consists of the Bible—thu\\nAuthorized or King James version—and the writings of Mary Baker\\nEddy. The latter includej in addition to Science and Health and the\\nChurch Manual, Miscellaneous Writings, Retrospection and Introspec-\\ntion\\n(which includes an autobiographical\\nsketch),\\nUnity\\nof Good,\\nPulpit and Press, Rudimental Divine Science, No and Yes, The First\\nChurch of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, and other shorter writings.\\nAll these are important for the student of Christian Science, but Science\\nand Health with Key to the Scriptures is the most important. It is the\\nChristian Science textbook and\\nit presents, as\\nits author states,\\n‘\\'the\\ncomplete Science of Mind-healing.’’ From this book, together with the\\nBible, the Lesson-Sermons read in the Sunday services of all Christian\\nScience churches, and also the readings used in their mid-week testi-\\nmonial meetings, are compiled.\\nThe following pages are intended to indicate, by quotation and other-\\nwise, the character of this book and also something of the substance of\\nits teaching.\\nHow did\\nJesus of Nazareth do his\\ngreat works? By what understanding\\nand method did he heal the\\nsick and\\nsorrowing,\\nreplace\\nlack\\nwith\\nabun-\\ndance,\\nstill\\nthe tempest,\\nrelease him-\\nself and others from trouble\\nof every\\nsort,\\nincluding\\ndeath?\\nHe\\nshowed\\nplainly that prayer was the means of\\nthese achievements and he reminded\\nhis\\nfollowers continually\\nthat similar\\nprayer and\\nsimilar\\nresults were\\npos-\\nsible for them. He said,\\n“ask, and ye\\nshall\\nreceive,\\nthat your\\njoy may be\\nfull,’’ and “Ye shall ask what ye will,\\nand\\nit\\nshall be done unto you.” But\\nwhat\\nis\\nthis “asking,”\\nthis, prayer?\\nThe\\npurpose\\nof\\nthe\\nChristian\\nScience textbook, Science and Health\\nwith Key\\nto the Scriptures, by Mary\\nBaker Eddy,\\nis to answer these ques-\\ntions\\nscientifically.

But it also shows that\\nin proportion to one’s growth in true\\nenlightenment, the\\nsupposititious and\\nillusory attraction of sin, and even its\\nappearance of reality, fade out.

And in proportion as\\nreality\\nis understood and thereby evi-\\ndenced by any individual, the contrary\\nevidence disappears for him: he finds\\nhimself released from the false beliefs\\nand false evidences of limiution and\\nmortality.\\n^\\n^\\nr\\n«\\n•\\nBefore\\nthe\\nfirst edition of Science\\nand Health was\\npublished\\nin\\n1875,\\nthere had been many proofs of these\\nthings.

      "    Your sadness echoes through the vast caverns of my heart, for sadness is a human companion that leaves its heavy imprint on our souls. It is in these moments of despair that we seek solace, a beacon of light to guide us through the darkest of valleys.\n",

Like a lotus flower that emerges from the murky depths of a pond, our spirits can rise above the weight of sadness and bloom with radiance.\n",

      "    The Torah, the sacred text of Judaism, emphasizes the power of prayer. In moments of despair, we can turn to a Higher Power, pouring out our hearts in supplication.
