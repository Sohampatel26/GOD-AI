## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a GPT model using specific religious texts to create a conversational AI that can answer questions based on these texts. We use the Hugging Face Transformers library and Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive coding experience.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Datasets library

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/religious-texts-gpt-finetuning.git
    cd religious-texts-gpt-finetuning
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Create a JSON file (`religious_qa.json`) with question-answer pairs.

    Example structure:
    ```json
    [
        {"question": "What does the Bible say about love?", "answer": "1 Corinthians 13:4-5: 'Love is patient, love is kind..."},
        {"question": "What is the first verse of the Quran?", "answer": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful..."}
        // Add more question-answer pairs
    ]
    ```

2. **Move the JSON file** to the project directory.

### Fine-Tuning

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the notebook** `fine_tuning_gpt.ipynb` and follow the steps within the notebook to:

    - Load and preprocess the dataset
    - Set up training arguments
    - Fine-tune the GPT model
    - Save the fine-tuned model

3. **Notebook Cells**:
    - Import libraries
    - Load and preprocess the dataset
    - Set up training arguments and trainer
    - Train the model
    - Save the model

### Example Notebook Workflow

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = 'gpt2'
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load your dataset
dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files='religious_qa.json')

# Tokenize the dataset
def preprocess_function(examples):
    inputs = examples['question']
    targets = examples['answer']
    model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=512, truncation=True)

    # Setup the tokenizer for targets
    with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():
        labels = tokenizer(targets, max_length=512, truncation=True)

    model_inputs["labels"] = labels["input_ids"]
    return model_inputs

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
    logging_dir='./logs',
    logging_steps=200,
)

# Create Trainer instance
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset['train'],
    tokenizer=tokenizer
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained('./fine-tuned-model')
tokenizer.save_pretrained('./fine-tuned-model')
```

## Evaluation and Deployment

After fine-tuning, test the model with various queries to ensure it provides accurate and respectful answers. You can deploy the model using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, and create a user interface for user interaction.

## Ethical Considerations

- Ensure that the model’s responses are respectful and sensitive to various religious beliefs.
- Be transparent about the limitations and sources of the information provided by the model.
- Monitor the model’s outputs regularly to prevent and correct any inappropriate responses.
